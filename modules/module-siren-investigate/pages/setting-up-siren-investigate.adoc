= Setting up Siren Investigate

This section includes information on how to set up Siren Investigate and get it running, including:

* Downloading

* Installing

* Starting

* Configuring

* Upgrading

NOTE: The instructions in this section are relevant for production deployments
only.


== Supported platforms

Packages of Siren Investigate are provided for and tested with Linux and
Windows. Because Siren Investigate runs on Node.js, the required Node.js
binaries for these platforms are included. Running Siren Investigate
against a separately maintained version of Node.js is not supported.

=== Version compatibility

Siren 10.3 introduced a new capability that allows users to upgrade to a
newer Investigate version without having to upgrade their Elasticsearch
and Federate backend. Upgrading the backend is a complex procedure as
the Elasticsearch version has to be upgraded with every major/minor
Federate release. By removing the dependence on a specific backend,
users can benefit from new advanced features by upgrading to the latest
Investigate version, without the complexity of a simultaneous
Federate/Elasticsearch upgrade.

Each Investigate version now supports several Elasticsearch/Federate
versions in the following way:

* Minimum supported Elasticsearch/Federate version - runs the set of
Siren features compatible with the Elasticsearch version used. This
includes all the features available in Siren 10.1, and all the features
in 10.2 except Data Reflection, Neo4j Support, Ingestion, and
Export/Scroll API.
* Feature complete Elasticsearch/Federate version - runs all current
Siren features
* Target Elasticsearch/Federate version - runs all current Siren
features and, being the most up-to-date version, is recommended in most
cases

=== Siren 10.3 compatibility

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Compatibility Level |Federate Version
|Minimum |5.6.10 - 10.1.1
|Feature Complete |6.8.0 - 10.3.0
|Target |6.8.0 - 10.3.0
|===

NOTE: If the Elasticsearch/Federate backend is more recent than the
Investigate version, it has to be within a minor release from
Investigate Target version so as not to break APIs.


When Investigate starts up, it checks the version of Federate it is
working with and compares with a compatibility matrix. It detects the
features that cannot be supported and switches them off in the user
interface. This is logged in the Investigate server, and the user can
see which features are unsupported by checking the About section (click
*Management* to see the About section).

[cols=",,",options="header",]

|Feature |Description |Minimum Federate Version
|Datasource Reflection |Import and mapping of data to Elasticsearch from
registered datasources |6.5.4-10.2.0

|===

Running different major version releases of Siren Investigate and
Elasticsearch, for example Siren Investigate 10.x and Elasticsearch 2.x,
is not supported, nor is running a minor version of Siren Investigate
that is newer than the version of Elasticsearch, for example Siren
Investigate 10.0.x and Elasticsearch 5.0.x.

Running a minor version of Elasticsearch that is higher than supported
version will generally work to facilitate an upgrade process where
Elasticsearch is upgraded first, for example Siren Investigate 10.0.x
and Elasticsearch 5.7.x. In this configuration, a warning will be logged
on Siren Investigate server startup, so it is only meant to be temporary
until Siren Investigate is upgraded to the same version as
Elasticsearch.

Running different patch version releases of Siren Investigate and
Elasticsearch, for example Siren Investigate 10.0.0-1 and Elasticsearch
5.6, is generally supported, though we encourage users to run the
supported versions of Siren Investigate and Elasticsearch down to the
patch version.









== Installing Siren Investigate

Siren Investigate is provided in the following package formats:

[cols=",",]
|===
|`+zip+` a|
The `+zip+` packages are provided for installation on Linux and Windows
and are the easiest choice for getting started with Siren Investigate.

<<Running Siren Investigate on Docker>> or <<Install Siren Investigate on Windows>>

|`+docker+` a|
Siren Investigate Docker images are available at
https://hub.docker.com/u/sirensolutions/.

See also https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.6/docker.html[Running Kibana on
Docker].

|===

IMPORTANT: If your Elasticsearch installation is protected by
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/5.6/xpack-security.html[X-Pack
Security], see
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/5.6/kibana.html[Using Kibana with
X-Pack Security] for additional setup instructions.



== Running Siren Investigate on Docker

Docker images for Siren Investigate are available from the
https://hub.docker.com/u/sirensolutions/[sirensolutions] organization on
https://hub.docker.com[Dockerhub].


=== Pulling the Image

Obtaining Siren Investigate for Docker is as simple as issuing a docker
pull command.

The Docker image for the latest Siren Investigate can be retrieved with
the following command:

[source,sh]
----
docker pull sirensolutions/siren-platform:latest
docker run -d -p 5606:5606 -p 9220:9220 sirensolutions/siren-platform:latest
----

Or for a specific version, for example 10.0.0:

[source,sh]
----
docker pull sirensolutions/siren-platform:10.0.0
docker run -d -p 5606:5606 -p 9220:9220 sirensolutions/siren-platform:10.0.0
----

For an image pre-populated with demonstration data:

[source,sh]
----
docker pull sirensolutions/siren-platform-demo-data:latest
docker run -d -p 5606:5606 -p 9220:9220 sirensolutions/siren-platform-demo-data:latest
----


=== Environment variable configuration

Under Docker, Siren Investigate can be configured using environment
variables. When the container starts, a helper process checks the
environment for variables that can be mapped to Siren Investigate
command-line arguments.

For compatibility with container orchestration systems, these
environment variables are written in all capitals, with underscores as
word separators. The helper translates these names to valid Siren
Investigate setting names.

Some example translations are shown here:

.Example Docker Environment Variables
[cols=",",]
|===
|*Environment Variable* |*Siren Investigate Setting*
|`+SERVER_NAME+` |`+server.name+`
|`+KIBANA_DEFAULTAPPID+` |`+kibana.defaultAppId+`
|`+XPACK_MONITORING_ENABLED+` |`+xpack.monitoring.enabled+`
|===

In general, any setting listed in <<Configuring Siren Investigate>> or
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/5.6/xpack-settings.html[X-Pack
Settings] can be configured with this technique.

These variables can be set with docker-compose like this:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  investigate:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:10.0.0
    environment:
      SERVER_NAME: siren.example.org
      ELASTICSEARCH_URL: http://elasticsearch.example.org
----

Because environment variables are translated to CLI arguments, they take
precedence over settings configured in `+investigate.yml+`.


==== Docker defaults

The default settings when using the `+siren-investigate+` image
(standalone Siren Investigate image) are:

[cols=",",]
|===
|`+elasticsearch.url+` |\http://localhost:9220
|`+server.basepath+` |`+""+`
|`+kibana.index+` |`+.siren+`
|===


=== Install Siren Investigate with ZIP package

Siren Investigate is provided for Linux and Windows as a `+.zip+`
package. These packages are the easiest formats to use when trying out
Siren Investigate.

The latest stable version of Siren Investigate can be found on the
https://support.siren.io[Siren Support Portal]. Descriptions of the
separate demonstration packages are also available there.


=== Download and install the Linux 64-bit package

After you have
https://support.siren.io/support/solutions/articles/17000057493-get-your-license[obtained
your license], you should have access to the
https://support.siren.io[Siren Support Portal]'s download pages. The
`+siren-investigate+` package can be downloaded from there, either by
clicking the package link in the browser or, right click the link, then
use the copied link as `+investigate-link+` as follows:

[source,sh]
----
wget {investigate-link}.zip
sha1sum siren-investigate-10.0.0-linux-x86_64.zip // <1> 
unzip siren-investigate-10.0.0-linux-x86_64.zip -d .
cd siren-investigate-10.0.0-linux-x86_64/ // <2> 
----

<1> Compare the SHA produced by `+sha1sum+` or `+shasum+` with the
published `+sha1.txt+` (found on the Siren Investigate download page on
the https://support.siren.io[Siren Support Portal]).
<2> This folder is known as `+$INVESTIGATE_HOME+`.


=== Running Siren Investigate from the command prompt

Siren Investigate can be started from the command prompt as follows:

[source,sh]
----
./bin/investigate
----
:experimental:
By default, Siren Investigate runs in the foreground, prints its logs to
the standard output (`+stdout+`), and can be stopped by
pressingÂ kbd:[Ctrl + C].


=== Siren Investigate configuration

Siren Investigate loads its configuration from the
`+$INVESTIGATE_HOME/config/investigate.yml+` file by default. The format
of this configuration file is explained in <<Configuring Siren Investigate>>.


=== Folder layout of Linux ZIP archive

The `+.zip+` packages are entirely self-contained.

This is very convenient because you do not have to create any
directories to start using Siren Investigate, and uninstalling is as
easy as removing the folder. However, it is advisable to change the
default locations of the configuration and data folders so that you do
not remove important data later on.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Type |Description |Default Location |Setting
|*home* |Siren Investigate home folder or `+$INVESTIGATE_HOME+` |Folder
created by unpacking the archive; in demonstration distributions, the
folder is `+siren-investigate+`. |

|*bin* |Binary scripts including `+kibi+` to start the Siren Investigate
server and `+kibi-plugin+` to install plugins |`+$INVESTIGATE_HOME\bin+`
|

|*config* |Configuration files including `+investigate.yml+`

on the fly. |`+$INVESTIGATE_HOME\optimize+` |

|*plugins* |The location of the plugin files. Each plugin will be
contained in a subfolder. |`+$INVESTIGATE_HOME\plugins+` |
|===


=== Install Siren Investigate on Windows

Siren Investigate can be installed on Windows using the `+.zip+`
package; zip packages can be downloaded from the
https://support.siren.io[download page]. The demonstration versions
contain a preconfigured Elasticsearch cluster in addition to Siren
Investigate.


=== Running Siren Investigate from the command prompt

Siren Investigate can be started from the command prompt as follows:

[source,sh]
----
.\bin\investigate.bat
----

By default, Siren Investigate runs in the foreground, prints its logs to
`+STDOUT+`, and can be stopped by pressingÂ kbd:[Ctrl + C].


=== Siren Investigate configuration

Siren Investigate loads its configuration from the
`+$INVESTIGATE_HOME/config/investigate.yml+` file by default. The format
of this configuration file is explained in <<Configuring Siren Investigate>>.


==== Folder layout of Windows ZIP archive

The `+.zip+` package is entirely self-contained.

This is very convenient because you do not have to create any
directories to start using Siren Investigate, and uninstalling Siren
Investigate is as easy as removing the folder. However, it is advisable
to change the default locations of the configuration and data folders so
that you do not remove important data later on.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]

|*plugins* |The location of the plugin files. Each plugin will be
contained in a subfolder. |`+%INVESTIGATE_HOME%\plugins+` |
|===


== Configuring Siren Investigate

The Siren Investigate server reads properties from the
`+investigate.yml+` file on startup. The default settings configure
Siren Investigate to run on `+localhost:5606+`. To change the host or
port number, or connect to Elasticsearch running on a different machine,
you must update your `+investigate.yml+` file. You can also enable SSL
and set a variety of other options.

External datasource configuration is documented in the xref:working-with-jdbc-datasources.adoc[Working with JDBC datasources] and xref:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[Legacy REST datasources]Â sections, while access control
configuration is documented in xref:authentication-and-access-control.adoc#_search_guard_integration_and_siren_investigate_access_control[Search Guard integration and Siren Investigate access control].

*Environment Variable Placeholders.*

It is possible to use environment variable placeholders in configuration
settings. The syntax of placeholders is `+${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}+`.

For example, to set `+elasticsearch.url+` to the value of the
environment variable `+ES_URL+`, edit `+config/investigate.yml+` as
follows:

[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.url: ${ES_URL}
----

specifies the default route when opening Siren Investigate. You can use
this setting to modify the landing page when opening Siren Investigate.

|`+elasticsearch.url:+` |Default: `+http://localhost:9220+`. The URL of
the Elasticsearch instance to use for all your queries.

|`+elasticsearch.preserveHost:+` |Default: `+true+`. When this settingâs
value is true Siren Investigate uses the hostname specified in the
`+server.host+` setting. When the value of this setting is `+false+`,
Siren Investigate uses the hostname of the host that connects to this
Siren Investigate instance.

|`+kibana.index:+` |Default: `+.siren+`. Siren Investigate uses an index
in Elasticsearch to store saved searches, visualizations and dashboards.
Siren Investigate creates a new index if the index does not already
exist.

|`+kibana.defaultAppId:+` |Default: `+discover+`. The default
application to load.

|`+tilemap+` a|
The tilemap is the base layer the map visualizations. To increase max
zoom level for mapping visualizations, copy the following object in the
`+investigate.yml+`file, this will increase the zoom level to 19 from
the default of 15.

----
tilemap: 
  url: "https://\{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/\{z}/\{x}/\{y}.png"
  options:

    subdomains: ['a']
    minZoom: 0
    maxZoom: 19
----

|`+tilemap.url:+` |The URL to the tile service that Siren Investigate
uses to display map tiles in tilemap visualizations. By default, Siren
Investigate reads this URL from an external metadata service, but users
can still xref:visualizations.adoc#_coordinate_map[override this
parameter] to use their own Tile Map Service.

attribution string.

|`+tilemap.options.subdomains:+` |An array of subdomains used by the
tile service. Specify the position of the subdomain in the URL with the
token `+{s}+`.

|`+regionmap+` a|
Specifies additional vector layers for use in
xref:visualizations.adoc#_region_map[Region Map]
visualizations. Each layer object points to an external vector file that
contains a GeoJSON FeatureCollection. The file must use the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System[WGS84 coordinate
reference system] and only include polygons. If the file is hosted on a
separate domain from Siren Investigate, the server needs to be CORS
(Cross Origin Request Security) enabled so that Siren Investigate can
download the file. The following example shows a valid regionmap
configuration.

an inner-join between the document stored in Elasticsearch and the
GeoJSON file. For example, if the field in the GeoJSON is called
`+Location+` and has city names, there must be a field in Elasticsearch
that holds the same values that Siren Investigate can then use to lookup
for the GeoShape data.

|`+regionmap.layers.fields.description:+` |Mandatory. The human readable
text that is shown under the Options tab when building the Region Map
visualization.

|`+elasticsearch.username:+` and `+elasticsearch.password:+` |If your
Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings
provide the username and password that the Siren Investigate server uses
to perform maintenance on the Siren Investigate index at startup. Your
Siren Investigate users still need to authenticate with Elasticsearch,
which is proxied through the Siren Investigate server.

|`+server.ssl.enabled+` |Default: `+false+`. Enables SSL for incoming

== Accessing Siren Investigate

Siren Investigate is a web application that you access through port
5606. All you need to do is point your web browser at the machine where
Siren Investigate is running and specify the port number. For example,
\http://localhost:5606Â or
\http://example.com:5606[http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5606].

When you access Siren Investigate, the
xref:discover.adoc[Discover] page loads by
default with the default index pattern selected. The time filter is set
to the last 15 minutes and the search query is set to match-all (`+*+`).

If you do not see any documents, try
xref:discover.adoc#_setting_the_time_filter[setting the time filter]
to a wider time range. If you still do not see any results, it is
possible that you do not _have_ any documents.


=== Checking Siren Investigate status

You can reach the Siren Investigate serverâs status page by navigating
to http://localhost:5606/status. The status page displays information
about the serverâs resource usage and lists the installed plugins.

=== Collecting Elasticsearch diagnostics

Click *Elasticsearch diagnostics* to generate a single file by
collecting different metrics about your Elasticsearch cluster. All
collected information are saved to a local file and never transferred
over a network. You can see a full list of Elasticsearch API calls by
clicking the more info (*i*) icon.

NOTE: For JSON formatted server status details, use the API endpoint at
`+http://localhost:5601/api/status+`.



== Connecting Siren Investigate to backend datasources

Siren can visualize data that is accessible by the Siren backend, which
is an Elasticsearch cluster enhanced by the Federate plugin.

The following diagram represents this concept. On the frontend, a user
looks at data, for example data in a dashboard or on the Graph Link
Analysis system. This data comes from Siren "searches", which reflect
queries that are sent to indices that are on the Elasticsearch backend.

It is useful to distinguish between two types of searches:

* *Index Pattern Searches*: Root definitions that describe which
Elasticsearch indices will be used. They can be as simple as the name of
the index itself or can be âpatternsâ e.g. _new_*_ to indicate âall the
indices that begin with news_â. For more information and examples, see
xref:management.adoc#_index_pattern_searches[Index Pattern Searches].
* *Other searches*: These are defined by filtering an Index Pattern
Search, for example starting from a âNewsâ Index Pattern Search, one
might create a âNews that contain the word Brexitâ search.

Inside the main Elasticsearch cluster (the one that the NodeJS Siren
application is connected to), indices can be of two types:

* *Physical indices*: These are regular Elasticsearch indices, typically
created via external ETL (e.g. Logstash) or via the Siren reflection
process (an ETL that keeps external tables in sync). For more
information, see xref:data-reflection.adoc[Data
Reflection].
* *Virtual indices*: These will simulate Elasticsearch indices but will
not copy data; instead, they will send queries to the remote backends
and will translate the query results.

Both physical and virtual indices can be used to create index patterns
(although in Siren 10.3, you cannot create wildcard patterns (*)
including virtual indices).

image:15d88cec7c9538.png[image]

Before you can start using Siren Investigate, you need to tell it which
Elasticsearch indices you want to explore. The first time you access
Siren Investigate, you are prompted to define an _index pattern search_
that matches the name of one or more of your indices. That is it. That
is all you need to configure to start using Siren Investigate. You can
create index pattern searches at any time from the
xref:management.adoc#_index_pattern_searches[Management] tab.

TIP: By default, Siren Investigate connects to the Elasticsearch instance
running on `+localhost+`. To connect to a different Elasticsearch
instance, modify the Elasticsearch URL in the `+investigate.yml+`
configuration file and restart Siren Investigate. For information about
using Siren Investigate with your production nodes, see
<<Using Siren Investigate in a production environment>>.


. Point your browser at port 5606 to access the Siren Investigate user
interface. For example,
http://localhost:5606Â orÂ http://example.com:5606[http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5606].

. Specify an index pattern search that matches the name of one or more of
your Elasticsearch indices. You may have to access the index pattern
search management in
theÂ Management tab. By
default, Siren Investigate guesses that you are working with data being
fed into Elasticsearch by Logstash. If thatâs the case, you can use the
defaultÂ `+logstash-*+`Â as your index pattern search. The asterisk
(`+*+`) matches zero or more characters in an indexâs name. If your
Elasticsearch indices follow some other naming convention, enter an
appropriate pattern. The "pattern" can also be the name of a single
index.
+
image:15d88cec7d2c63.png[image]

. Select the index field that contains the timestamp that you want to use
to perform time-based comparisons. Siren Investigate reads the index
mapping to list all the fields that contain a timestamp. If your index
does not have time-based data, switch off theÂ  *Index contains
time-based events* option.

. Click *Create* to add the index pattern search. This first pattern is
automatically configured as the default. When you have more than one
index pattern search, you can designate which one to use as the default
by clicking on the star icon above the index pattern search title from
[.menuchoice]#Management > Data Model#.

All done. Siren Investigate is now connected to your Elasticsearch data.
Siren Investigate displays a read-only list of fields configured for the
matching index.

NOTE: Siren Investigate relies on dynamic mapping to use fields in
visualizations and manage the `+.siren+` index. If you have switched off
dynamic mapping, you need to manually provide mappings for the fields
that Siren Investigate uses to create visualizations. For more
information, see <<Siren
Investigate and Elasticsearch Dynamic Mapping>>.


=== Start exploring your data

You are ready to dive in to your data:

* Search and browse your data interactively from the
xref:discover.adoc[Discover] page.
* Chart and map your data from the
xref:visualizations.adoc[Visualizations]
page.
* Create and view custom dashboards from the
xref:dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] page.

For a step-by-step introduction to these core Siren Investigate
concepts, see the
link:/document/preview/60141#UUID-697eb485-b896-3d67-f862-e125d7226e0b[Getting
Started] tutorial.


=== Siren Investigate and Elasticsearch dynamic mapping

By default, Elasticsearch enables
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/dynamic-mapping.html[dynamic
mapping] for fields. Siren Investigate needs dynamic mapping to use
fields in visualizations correctly, as well as to manage the `+.siren+`
index where saved searches, visualizations, and dashboards are stored.

If your Elasticsearch use case requires you to switch off dynamic
mapping, you need to manually provide mappings for fields that Siren
Investigate uses to create visualizations. You also need to manually
enable dynamic mapping for the `+.siren+` index.

The following procedure assumes that the `+.siren+` index does not
already exist in Elasticsearch and that the `+index.mapper.dynamic+`
setting in `+elasticsearch.yml+` is set to `+false+`:

[arabic]
. Start Elasticsearch.
. Create the `+.siren+` index with dynamic mapping enabled just for that
index:
+
[source,shell]
----
PUT .siren
{
  "index.mapper.dynamic": true
}
----
. Start Siren Investigate and navigate to the web UI and verify that
there are no error messages related to dynamic mapping.



== Using Siren Investigate with tribe nodes

NOTE: While tribe nodes have been deprecated in Elasticsearch in favor of
xref:management.adoc#_cross_cluster_search[Cross-cluster search], you can still use Siren Investigate with tribe nodes
until Elasticsearch version 7.0. Unlike tribe nodes, using cross-cluster
search in Siren Investigate requires no server-side configurations and
does not switch off functionality like xref:dev-tools.adoc#_console[Console].


Siren Investigate can be configured to connect to a
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-tribe.html[tribe
node] for data retrieval. Because tribe nodes cannot create indices,
Siren Investigate additionally requires a separate connection to a node
to maintain state. When configured, searches and visualizations will
retrieve data using the tribe node and administrative actions (such as
saving a dashboard) will be sent to non-tribe node.

*Configuring Siren Investigate for tribe nodes*

Tribe nodes take all of the same configuration options used when
configuring Elasticsearch in `+investigate.yml+`. Tribe options are
prefixed with `+elasticsearch.tribe+` and at a minimum requires a URL:

[source,text]
----
elasticsearch.url: "<your_administration_node>"
elasticsearch.tribe.url: "<your_tribe_node>"
----

When configured to use a tribe node, actions that modify Siren
Investigateâs state will be sent to the node at `+elasticsearch.url+`.
Searches and visualizations will retrieve data from the node at
`+elasticsearch.tribe.url+`. Itâs acceptable to use a node for
`+elasticsearch.url+` that is part of one of the clusters that a tribe
node is pointing to.

The full list of configurations can be found at
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.6/settings.html[Configuring
Kibana].

*Limitations*

Due to the ambiguity of which cluster is being used, certain features
are switched off in Siren Investigate:

* Console
* Managing users and roles with the X-pack plugin



== Using Siren Investigate in a production environment

How you deploy Siren Investigate largely depends on your use case. If
you are the only user, you can run it on your local machine and
configure it to point to whatever Elasticsearch instance you want to
interact with. Conversely, if you have a large number of heavy users,
you may need to load balance across multiple instances that are all
connected to the same Elasticsearch cluster.

While Siren Investigate is not terribly resource intensive, we still
recommend running Siren Investigate separate from your Elasticsearch
data or master nodes.

Make sure to set the configuration file as readable only to the user
running the Siren Investigate process as it contains encryption keys to
protect configuration settings stored in Elasticsearch; if you are
connecting Siren Investigate to external datasources, we also recommend
to use credentials with no write privileges as they are not required by
the system.

=== Access control

Siren Investigate is compatible with Elastic x-pack and Search Guard to
enable index and document level access control.

For more information about access control features, see the
xref:authentication-and-access-control.adoc[Access Control] section.

=== Load balancing across multiple Elasticsearch nodes

If you have multiple nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster, the easiest
way to distribute Siren Investigate requests across the nodes is to run
an Elasticsearch _client_ node on the same machine as Siren Investigate.
Elasticsearch client nodes are essentially smart load balancers that are
part of the cluster. They process incoming HTTP requests, redirect
operations to the other nodes in the cluster as needed, and gather and
return the results. For more information, see
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modules-node.html[Node]
in the Elasticsearch reference.

To use a local client node to load balance Siren Investigate requests:

[arabic]
. Install Elasticsearch on the same machine as Siren Investigate.
. Configure the node as a client node. In `+elasticsearch.yml+`, set
both `+node.data+` and `+node.master+` to `+false+`:
+
....
#    You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but
#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,
#    aggregating results, and so on)
#
node.master: false
node.data: false
node.ingest: false
....
. Configure the client node to join your Elasticsearch cluster. In
`+elasticsearch.yml+`, set the `+cluster.name+` to the name of your
cluster.
+
....
cluster.name: "my_cluster"
....
. Make sure Siren Investigate is configured to point to your local
client node. In `+investigate.yml+`, the `+elasticsearch.url+` should be
set to `+http://localhost:9220+`.
+
....
# The Elasticsearch instance to use for all your queries.
elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9220"
....


== Upgrading from Investigate 10.1.x or 10.2.x

You can migrate directly from Investigate 10.1.3 and higher to 10.3.0.
If upgrading from an earlier version of Investigate, it is recommended
that you first upgrade to 10.1.3 (which also supports Elasticsearch
5.x). You can then upgrade from 10.1.3 to 10.3.0.

NOTE: When upgrading both Investigate and Elasticsearch, you should upgrade
the Investigate objects first, and only then upgrade Elasticsearch.


The recommended version of Elasticsearch is 6.8.0 (version 6.5.4 is also
supported). Please see
link:/document/preview/74614#UUID-614c3407-2425-bbec-d555-cf99fc9605ff[Breaking
Changes] and the link:#UUID-c90c7882-8ae2-2392-260c-ef61485f6027[Search
Guard Integration and Siren Investigate access control] to configure
Searchguard security settings correctly for Elasticsearch 6.8.0.8.
Breaking changes

IMPORTANT: Before you upgrade Siren Investigate, you must take account of the
security implications of the new features installed. Details of the
necessary security procedures can be found in
<<Security standardization>>.


An existing Siren Investigate installation can be upgraded as follows:

. Backup the 10.1.x `+.siren+` index.

. Backup the Siren Investigate configuration file
(`+config/investigate.yml+`).

. Backup the `+.sirenaccess+` if ACL (Access Control Layer) is enabled

. If you are running Elasticsearch 6.3.2, you can optionally upgrade to
version 6.8.0
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/setup-upgrade.html).

. Before restarting each Elasticsearch node, ensure you install a
compatible version of the
link:/document/preview/104019#UUID-443698b7-dcb2-87fb-fd89-3e672f069521[Siren
Federate] plugin and access control plugins (Searchguard or X-pack
security) if required

. Download and extract the new Siren Investigate version.

. Copy the previous configuration file to the `+config+` folder of the new
installation.

. Check for breaking changes to the configuration. Please see
link:/document/preview/74614#UUID-614c3407-2425-bbec-d555-cf99fc9605ff[Breaking
Changes] and the xref:authentication-and-access-control.adoc#_search_guard_integration_and_siren_investigate_access_control[Search
Guard Integration and Siren Investigate access control]

. Install the compatible versions of third party Siren Investigate/Kibana
plugins that you may need into the `+/plugins+` folder.

. Execute the `upgrade` command.

NOTE: Elasticsearch requires a matching version of Search Guard. For example,
Elasticsearch 6 requires Search Guard 6. For information on upgrading
Search Guard, see https://docs.search-guard.com/latest/upgrading-560.


=== Backing up and restoring the Siren Investigate indices

Before upgrading, you should have a backup of the `+.siren+` index; the
recommended way to perform regular backups of Elasticsearch indexes is
through the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modules-snapshots.html[snapshot
and restore modules].

Siren Investigate ships with a command line interface for creating dumps
of the `+.siren+` index and, in case the `+ACL+` is enabled, the
`+.sirenaccess+` index as well. An index dump is composed of two parts:
its mappings and its data.

==== Backup

The backup command requires a running Elasticsearch instance and the
path to a folder where the dumps will be written to.

You can find out more about its options by executing the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./bin/investigate backup --help
----

For example, the following line will dump in `+<MY_FOLDER>+` the
`+.siren+` index and the `+.sirenaccess+` index if the option
`+investigate_access_control.acl.enabled+` is true in
`+investigate.yml+`:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./bin/investigate backup --backup-dir <MY_FOLDER>
----

==== Restore

The restore command requires a running Elasticsearch instance and the
path to a folder where the dumps were written to by the previous backup
command.

You can find out more about its options by executing the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./bin/investigate restore --help
----

For example, you can restore the previously saved indices by executing
the command and pointing to the dump folder, with `+.sirenaccess+` as
well if the option `+investigate_access_control.acl.enabled+` is true in
`+investigate.yml+`:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./bin/investigate restore --backup-dir <MY_FOLDER>
----

=== Upgrading the Siren index

To upgrade the objects in the `+.siren+` index (dashboards,
visualizations, and so on), move to the folder in which Siren
Investigate is installed and execute the following command:

[source,shell]
----
bin/investigate upgrade
----

The command will look for out of date objects and upgrade them, for
example:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/investigate upgrade
  log   [17:58:33.494] [info][status][plugin:elasticsearch] Status changed from uninitialized to yellow - Waiting for Elasticsearch
  log   [17:58:36.127] [info][migrations] Executing migration "Upgrade scripts from version 1 to version 2"
  log   [17:58:36.141] [info][migrations] Executed migration "Upgrade scripts from version 1 to version 2"

  log   [17:58:36.158] [info][migrations] Executing migration "Upgrade saved queries from version 1 to version 2"
  log   [17:58:36.242] [info][migrations] Executed migration "Upgrade saved queries from version 1 to version 2"
  log   [17:58:36.242] [info][migrations] Executing migration "Upgrade saved templates from version 1 to version 2"
  log   [17:58:36.303] [info][migrations] Executed migration "Upgrade saved templates from version 1 to version 2"
  log   [17:58:36.303] [info][migrations] Executing migration "Upgrade saved queries definitions in external query terms aggregation, enhanced search results and query viewer."
  log   [17:58:36.400] [info][migrations] Executed migration "Upgrade saved queries definitions in external query terms aggregation, enhanced search results and query viewer."
Upgraded 20 objects.
----

It is possible to run the command multiple times, however running the
command at the same time from multiple machines is not supported.

The `+upgrade+` command runs an automatic backup of the siren indices
(`+.siren+`, `+.sirenaccess+`) and restores them (after deleting the
existing index) in the event of a problem in the `+upgrade+` process -
ensuring the system is not left in an unusable state. In the event of a
successful upgrade, the backup is removed but if there is an issue, the
backed up indexes are stored in the backup folder (defaults to the
`+/data+` folder).

You can specify various flags to control the backup/restore process.

* `+--backup-dir <path>+`: Custom backup folder path to store the index
backup.
* `+--config <path>+`: Path to the configuration file.
* `+--delete-backup+`: Deletes the backup of the indexes after the
upgrade process completes.
* `+--dont-backup+`: Runs the upgrade process without creating a backup
of the indexes.
* `+-y+`: Accepts all of the options, for example, backup the indexes
and remove the indexes before restoring.


== Security standardization

The purpose of security standardization is to provide standard security
configuration for all possible backends, and full support for
Investigate 10.3.0.

This entails standardizing both action groups and role mappings.

*Procedure*

To standardize your security according to new action groups:

* Download the applicable security bundle below.
* Add any new client-specific roles or action groups you have added (if
any) based on the action group and action name changes listed below.
* Put the modified configuration files in the
./elasticsearch/config/sgconfig/ folder and
xref:authentication-and-access-control.adoc#_uploading_the_configuration_to_the_cluster[upload the configuration
to the cluster].
* Ensure that you explicitly specify your ACL admin_role and Sentinl
user_role in investigate.yml as defaults may have changed.

*Standard sgconfig bundles*

The following sgconfig bundles are available:

* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pwN6HEysCvYNefeuMEob689DHHts4bmq/view?usp=sharing[sgconfig-standard-10.1.x]
