= Data model

To use Siren Investigate you must define the data that you want to
explore by configuring the data model.

From [.menuchoice]#Management > Data Model#, you can create:

* *Index pattern searches*: A search based on a pattern that matches one
or more Elasticsearch indices or virtual indices (see
xref:working-with-jdbc-datasources.adoc#_siren_investigate_datasource_configuration[Siren Investigate datasource configuration]).
* *Child searches*: A sub-search based on an index pattern search
created by adding more specific filters or queries.
* *Entity identifiers (EIDs)*: A virtual entity concept used to connect
data sets using common concepts. For example, a `+company+` is located
in a `+city+` and an `+investor+` lives in a `+city+`. There is no
direct relation between the two data sets, but investors can be found in
the same city in which the company is located. 

Data may also be in an index, either directly in Elasticsearch or in a
Virtual Index mapped to an external JDBC datasource.


== Creating an index pattern search

Click *Create Index Pattern Search*.

Here, you can choose a name for the entity, add a long and short
descriptions and, using an icon picker and color picker, choose an icon
and color that will be associated with that entity in graph views, for
example when you select the Graph View tab.

NOTE: The colon ':' has been deprecated in index names, and should not be
used.


For more details on creating an index pattern search, see
xref:management.adoc#_index_pattern_searches[Index pattern searches].



=== Editing an index pattern search

You can view and edit multiple properties. They are grouped into tabs:

* *Data*: Browse data and create child searches
* *Data model graph*: Explore the relations graph.
* *Fields*: View fields information.
* *Info*: Modify search properties such as name, icon, label and
description.
* *Relations*: Add relationships.
* *Scripted Fields*: Create scripted fields.
* *Source Filters*: Add source filters.

To save your changes, click *Save*.

==== Data

From this tab you can:

* Generate a dashboard and populate it with visualizations created
automatically from the currently selected fields.
* Create a child search.
* Add filters.

==== Fields

The *fields* tab displays properties for each field. A check mark
indicates the presence of a property:

* *Name*.
* *Type*.
* *Format*.
* *Searchable*: Can be used in the filter bar.
* *Aggregateable*: Can be used in visualization aggregations.
* *Excluded*: Excluded from _source when it is fetched.
* *Primary key*: The primary key of an entity identifier.
* *Single value*: A field that is not an array.

To configure the field, click the *Edit* icon in the field’s row:

* *Format*: Enables you to control the way that specific values are
displayed. It can also cause values to be completely changed and prevent
highlighting in *Discover* from working. The following options are
available:
** Boolean
** color
** string (default)
** truncated string
** URL
* *Popularity*.
* *Primary key*.
* *Single value*.

Click *Update field* to save your changes. Alternatively, click *Cancel*
to abandon your changes.

==== Info

The *Info* tab enables you to set the following properties:

* *Name of the search*: The search name, typically describing returned
entity types, for example: "users", "logs firewall 1", "financial
articles".
* *Icon*.
* *Color*.
* *Label when visualized in the graph browser*: How to compose the label
used when records are visualized on the graph. This can either be a
*Scripted Label* or a *Document Field*.
* *Short description*.
* *Index pattern used by this search*: The pattern used to select the
indexes to receive queries from the search. By changing the pattern you
can change the index or even select multiple indexes (* is a wildcard).
For example, `+logstash-*+`. Changing this setting will impact this
search, the searches derived from this and all the associated visual
components.
* *Time Filter field name*: Used to filter events with the global time
filter.

image:dm4.png[image]

==== Relations

The *Relations* tab enables you to define relations between entities:

* *Source entity*: Select a *Field*.
* *Labels*: Select or create a new label for each direction of the
relation.
* *Target entity*: Select a *Search* and a *Field* or select an entity
identifier.

image:dm5.png[image]

==== Scripted fields

Scripted fields are computed in real time from your data. They can be
used in visualizations and displayed in your documents. However, they
cannot be searched.

CAUTION: Familiarize yourself with script fields
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-script-fields)
and scripts in aggregations
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html#_values_source)
before using scripted fields.

Scripted fields can be used to display and aggregate calculated values.
As such, they can be very slow, and when configured incorrectly, can
cause Siren Investigate to become unusable. There is no protection from
unexpected exceptions caused by script errors.


Scripted fields use the languages which are enabled in the backend. By
default this is the Painless Elasticsearch language
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.2/modules-scripting-painless.html).

NOTE: Ensure that you access Elasticsearch documentation that matches the
backend version you are using.


To access values in the document use the following format:

`+doc['some_field'].value+`

Painless is powerful but easy to use. It provides access to many native
Java APIs
(www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modules-scripting-painless.html#painless-api)
and has an easy to learn syntax.

Currently, Siren Investigate does not support named functions in
Painless scripts.

Alternatively you can use Lucene Expressions
(http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modules-scripting-expression.html[www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modules-scripting-expression.html]).
These are a lot like JavaScript, but limited to basic arithmetic,
bitwise and comparison operations.

Lucene Expressions have the following limitations:

* Only numeric, boolean, date and geo_point fields may be accessed.
* Stored fields are not available.
* If a field is sparse (only some documents contain a value), documents
missing the field will have a value of 0.

Lucene Expressions support the following operators and functions:

* *Arithmetic operators*: +, -, *, /, %
* *Bitwise operators*: |, &, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
* *Boolean operators* (including the ternary operator): &&, ||, !, ?:
* *Comparison operators*: <, ⇐, ==, >=, >
* *Common mathematic functions*: abs, ceil, exp, floor, ln, log10, logn,
max, min, sqrt, pow
* *Trigonometric library functions*: acosh, acos, asinh, asin, atanh,
atan, atan2, cosh, cos, sinh, sin, tanh, tan
* *Distance functions*: haversin
* *Miscellaneous functions*: min, max

Scripted fields have the following properties:

* *Name*.
* *Language*:
** expression
** painless (default)
* *Type*:
** Boolean
** date
** number
** string
* *Format*: Enables you to control the way that specific values are
displayed. It can also cause values to be completely changed and prevent
highlighting in *Discover* from working. The following options are
available:
** Boolean
** bytes
** color
** duration
** number (default)
** percentage
** string
** URL
* *Popularity*.
* *Primary key*.
* *Single value*.
* *Script*.

Click *Create field* to save your changes. Alternatively, click *Cancel*
to abandon your changes.

==== Source filters

Source filters can be used to exclude one or more fields when fetching
the document source. This happens when viewing a document in Discover,
or with a table displaying results from a saved search in Dashboard.
Each row is built using the source of a single document. If you have
documents with large or unimportant fields you may benefit from
filtering those out at this lower level.

Note that multi-fields will incorrectly appear as matches in the table.
These filters only apply to fields in the original source document, so
that matching multi-fields are actually not filtered.

Enter a string in the Source Filter in the box and click Add. Filters
accept wildcards, for example `+user*+` will return fields starting with
`+user+`.


=== Removing an index pattern search

Select the index pattern search from the left menu.

Click Delete.


=== Creating a child search

After you have created an index pattern search, you can create more
specific searches. For example, if your main index pattern search is
`+Companies+` you can now create a narrower selection such as
`+Companies from New York+`:

Select the Companies index pattern search on the left menu.

Go to the Data tab.

Search for `+New York+` and press Enter.

Click Create Child Search.

Enter `+Companies from New York+` and click Save.

The child search appears nested under Companies on the left side.

NOTE: Child searches cannot currently be nested, so there can be only one
level of child search, spanning from the Index Pattern Search. This is
because certain query modifiers, which appear as filters, could in
theory even expand the result set. Note also that data model relations
are always defined at Index Pattern Search (or EID) level, and are
inherited by child searches.


*Editing a child search*

To save your changes, click Save.

*Removing a child search*

Select the child search from the left menu.

Click Delete.



== How to use entity identifiers

Siren 10 introduces the concept of an "Entity Identifier" (EID).
Previously, in Siren, to be able to join between two indexes you had to
specify that there existed a direct connection between them. For
example, if you had two logs which could be connected by the IP value,
you would have specified a direct connection, thus creating a relational
button between the two.

But what if you have many indexes having IPs (or anything else: MAC
Addresses, User IDs, URLs, Port Numbers, Transaction IDs, and so on)
that are in multiple roles (Source IP, Destination IP) and it may be
useful to join from any of these roles and indexes to any other role and
index?

The new relational model enables this automatically.

For example, in this configuration, we have defined the IP concept as an
EID and tied it in with other indexes where IPs show up. For each
connection, we specify the name of the relation that describes the role
of the IP in that index (Is it the `+source+` IP in that log or the
`+blocked+` IP?).

image:dm6.png[Relations Graph]

Using only this configuration, you can now have buttons that explore the
ontology and show you all possible matches across your data. At this
point, one click and you will be pivoting to the target dashboard, with
the right relational filter applied.

For example, to see the records of the Apache logs where the Agent IP
matches the Destination IP in the current log, navigate from
"Destination IP" as per the picture:

image:dm7.png[Automatic relational buttons]

Entity identifiers are great for anything that identifies "things"
across indexes but does not have an index per se (otherwise, you would
pivot to it). Things like Phone Numbers, but also Tags, Labels from
standalone indexes, and so on. In practice a single Excel spreadsheet
can be seen as a "knowledge graph" if you consider labels as identifiers
that interconnect records. Here is an example with entity identifiers
(Tissue and Organism) in a Life Science deployment.

image:dm8.png[Knowledge Graph]

Note that the automatic connections between dashboards are seen when
using the new relational button. The old one will still require manual
inputs on which relation to show where.

image:dm9.png[Visualize]

Again, this is how the new relational button appears in action.

image:dm10.png[Automatic relational buttons]

*Creating an entity identifier*

Click Create Entity Identifier.

Enter a unique name in the Entity Identifier field.

The entity identifier appears on the left side.

image:dm11.png[image]

*Editing an entity identifier*

To save any changes, click Save.

*Removing an entity identifier*

Select the entity identifier from the left menu.

Click Delete.



== Creating relationships

Relationships are defined from a Class to other Classes. But, it is not
possible to define a relationship between two entity identifiers.

A relationship is defined as a join operation between two indices with
the following fields:

* *The Left Field*: the field of the local index to join on;
* *Right Class*: (the EID or Index pattern) to connect to;
* *Right Field* (only if the Right Class is an Index Pattern): the field
of the right index to join with; and
* *Label*: the label of the relation.

image:dm12.png[Data model]

New relations are created by clicking Add Relation. Relations do not
need to be created in both originating and target classes as they appear
automatically in both edit screens when created.

Clicking Visualize data model as a graph will show it in a visual
representation where the currently selected class is highlighted, for
example in this case

image:dm13.png[Relations Graph]

== How to name relations

Naming is a very hard problem in any domain. In Siren, naming entities
and relationships incorrectly will result in dashboards that are
difficult to navigate.

When naming things, imagine yourself in the place of the user at the
moment where the relational navigation is performed. Say that you are
looking at _companies_, how would you refer to _investments_?

A possibly natural way is to say that a _company_ received an
_investment_. However, if you are thinking of investment, you can say it
has been _secured by_ a _company_.

In the user interface, look at the directions of the arrows and think of
_X relationship Y_ and _Y relationship X_. For example:

image:dm14.png[How to name relations]

In this case we are using two different verbs, but often the simple
solution is to use active/passive, for example "_saw_ and "seen by".
Sometimes the inverse is the same property is the same, for example
"brother of" or "spouse".

As a general rule, it is always best to keep things quite short. For
example, _source_/_is source of_ and so on.

For more information about the component that provides the navigation
between relationally connected dashboards, see
link:#UUID-4eba2a8c-a314-f284-43b5-a2f8f120c6e2[Relational Navigator].



== Relations auto-discovery wizard

Siren Investigate can attempt to automatically identify the relational
configuration between any set of Index Pattern Searches.

Go to the *Management > Data Model > Relations* page and click the
*Relations auto-discovery wizard* button which located on the right
below the relations .

image:dm15.png[image]

Select the index pattern searches to analyze for relations. The default
settings for the wizard are usually good enough, but you can check the
other tabs for additional controls.

image:dm16.png[image]

In the **EID Patterns**tab, regular expression can be defined to
identify particular types of data to match to EIDs e.g URL, email
address, IP address etc.

image:dm17.png[image]

More generation parameters are available in the *Advanced Parameters*
tab. The available presets are suited for most cases, but you can also
edit complete parameters list for full control.

image:dm18.png[image]

Click *Ok* to start the detection procedure.



=== Report

At the end of the detection process, all found relations are presented
in a report.

The *Suggested Relations* tab displays found relations grouped by source
endpoint (either a field or an Entity Identifier). Selecting a source
endpoint will open the list of all its related target fields.

image:dm19.png[image]

Fields in the report can be included or excluded from the output result
by selecting or clearing the appropriate check box.

To provide a clear idea of the data connected in the relations, clicking
a target field will open an exploitative window with 100 sample
documents per endpoint with highlighted matched values.

You can change a source endpoint by clicking on the drop-down button
before its name. This is sometimes useful to correct mistakes in the
generation procedure, or if you prefer to have a different relation type
(direct relation or passing through an Entity Identifier).

The name of Entity Identifiers is also editable. Note that assigning the
same Entity Identifier name on two different sources will merge them
into a single output identifier.

The *Already Existing Relations* tab in the report can be used to track
the situation of existing relations in the data set against the reported
relations. Note that *Found relations* in this tab don’t also appear as
*Suggested Relations*, since they already exist and should not be
duplicated.

image:dm20.png[image]

For further insight about the generation process, you can inspect
details about each analyzed field in the *Per-Field Notes* tab, and the
full log of the procedure is available in the *Log* tab.

=== Temporary Relations

Click *Ok* to close the report and put all selected relations in a
temporary state. They are shown in light blue in the Data Model page but
will otherwise be ignored in other parts of Siren Investigate.

image:dm21.png[image]

Temporary relations can also be seen in the graph.

image:dm22.png[image]

The temporary state is useful to provide a final overview of the newly
generated relations and enable further customization, as if they were
manually inserted (for example, changing the link names).

CAUTION: Temporary relations are associated with the current browser session. If
the browser closes, all temporary relations are lost.


You can review and save each temporary relation individually by clicking
on the disk icon of its entry in the *DataModel > Relations* tab, while
removing the entry will discard it permanently.

If you are sure that all the temporary auto-relations are fine, you can
also click *Save All* in the upper info banner to save them in bulk.
Conversely, click *Remove All* to discard all the temporary relations.

Saving an Index Pattern Search or Entity Identifier will also save all
its temporary relations.
