Here's the second, copied from AUG... then I added the png... then I put it in a sub-bullet...

* The header in AsciiDoc must start with a document title.

= Document Title

Keep in mind that the header is optional.

* Optional Author and Revision information immediately follows the header title.

OK, copying failing markup to here...

* *Layers* - This is where layers (or layer groups) can be specified
  from a WMS server. There are two options:
  ** *If you have added a URL to a CORS-enabled WMS server* -
  Investigate will internally run a WMS getCapabilities request and will
  populate a list of layers that can be added by clicking ①. These can
  be ordered, by clicking and dragging ② as below. The layer at the top
  of the list is drawn furthest in the background.

  ** *If your URL is not a CORS-enabled WMS server* - The UI will remain
  the same. You can order your layers, separated by a comma. The first
  layer you specify will be drawn the furthest in the background.

[NOTE]
====
You can still see the available layers for the WMS by running a
  `+getCapabilities+` request. Below is an example from a local instance
  of Geoserver:

`+http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities+`
