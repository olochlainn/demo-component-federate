The *Dev Tools* page contains development tools that you can use to
interact with your data in Siren Investigate.



== Console

The Console plugin provides a UI to interact with the REST API of
Elasticsearch. Console has two main areas: the *editor*, where you
compose requests to Elasticsearch, and the *response* pane, which
displays the responses to the request.

Console understands commands in a cURL-like syntax. For example the
following Console command

[source,js]
----
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
----

is a simple `+GET+` request to Elasticsearch’s `+_search API+`. Here is
the equivalent command in cURL.

[source,bash]
----
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_search" -H "Content-Type: application/json"-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}'
----

In fact, you can paste the command into Console and it will
automatically be converted into the Console syntax.

When typing a command, Console will make context sensitive
<<Console,suggestions>>. These
suggestions can help you explore parameters for each API, or to just
speed up typing. Console will suggest APIs, indexes and field names.

After you have typed a command in to the left pane, you can submit it to
Elasticsearch by clicking the little green triangle that appears next to
the URL line of the request. Notice that as you move the cursor around,
the little triangle and wrench icons follow you around. We call this the
<<Console,Action Menu>>. You can
also select multiple requests and submit them all at once.

When the response come back, you should see it in the left panel:

=== The console user interface

In this section you will find a more detailed description of the UI of
the Console. The basic aspects of the UI are explained in the
<<Console>> section.


=== Multiple requests support

The Console editor enables writing multiple requests below each other.
As shown in the <<Console>> section, you can submit a request to
Elasticsearch by positioning the cursor and using the
Action Menu. Similarly
you can select multiple requests in one go:

Console will send the request one by one to Elasticsearch and show the
output on the right pane as Elasticsearch responds. This is very handy
when debugging an issue or trying query combinations in multiple
scenarios.

Selecting multiple requests also enables you to auto format and copy
them as cURL in one go.


=== Auto formatting

The console enables you to auto format messy requests. To do so,
position the cursor on the request you would like to format and select
Auto Indent from the action menu:

Console will adjust the JSON body of the request and it will now look
like this:

If you select Auto Indent on a request that is already perfectly
formatted, Console will collapse the request body to a single line per
document. This is very handy when working with Elasticsearch’s bulk
APIs:

=== Keyboard shortcuts

The console comes with a set of keyboard shortcuts making working with
it even more efficient. Here is an overview:

==== General editing

* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+A#: Auto indent current request.
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Space#: Open Auto complete (even if not typing).
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Enter#: Submit request.
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Up#: Jump to the previous request start.
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Down#: Jump to the next request end.
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Alt+L#: Collapse/expand current scope.
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Alt+0#: Collapse all scopes but the current one.
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+Alt+Shift+0#: Expand all scopes but the current one.

==== When auto-complete is visible

* Down: Switch focus to auto-complete menu. Use arrows to further select
a term.
* Enter or Tab: Select the currently selected or the top most term in
auto-complete menu.
* Esc: Close auto-complete menu.


=== History

The console maintains a list of the last 500 requests that were
successfully executed by Elasticsearch. The history is available by
clicking the `+History+` icon on the top right side of the window. The
icons opens the history panel where you can see the old requests. You
can also select a request here and it will be added to the editor at the
current cursor position.

=== Settings

The console has multiple settings you can set. All of them are available
in the Settings panel. To open the panel click the `+Settings+` icon on
the top right.

=== Configuring the console

You can add the following options in the `+config/investigate.yml+`
file:

`+console.enabled+`::
  *Default: true* Set to false to switch off the Console. Toggling this
  will cause the server to regenerate assets on the next startup, which
  may cause a delay before pages start being served.


== Translate join query

Siren Investigate has a tool for translating Siren Investigate specific
DSL query syntax into raw Elasticsearch query syntax.

To access it, go to `+/app/kibana#/dev_tools/translateJoinQuery+` in the
URL bar.

Paste your DSL query into the *Raw Query* box at the top.

Then click *Translate* to see the raw Elasticsearch query in the
*Translated Query* box at the bottom.
