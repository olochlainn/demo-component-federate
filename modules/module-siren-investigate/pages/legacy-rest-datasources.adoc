= Legacy REST datasources

Siren Investigate provides visualizations and aggregations to integrate
data from REST APIs. This section explains how to configure
link:#UUID-da4bad96-3043-850c-2758-f1b74cd5a949_datasource-queries[queries] and
link:#UUID-92fbd47b-36df-9366-c6e5-ca536e139ca2[query templates].

== Configuration


To create a new external datasource navigate to "Settings/Datasources".

First fill the datasource title and name then select `+REST+`, then set
the following parameters:

* `+timeout+`: Connection timeout in milliseconds.
* `+cache_enabled+`: Enable server side cache for this datasource.
* `+max_age+`: The maximum age of an object in the cache, in
milliseconds.
* `+url+`: The URL of the REST API.
* `+response_type+`: The API results format. Currently only JSON is
supported.
* `+username+`: If set, the username to specify in HTTP Basic
credentials.
* `+password+` (optional): The password to specify in HTTP Basic
credentials if a username is set.
* `+auth_token+` (optional): The token to set in Token Authentication
headers.

To control the maximum number of query results kept in cache, set the
`+investigate_core.datasource_cache_size+` parameter in
`+investigate.yml+` and restart Siren Investigate.

== Parameters encryption

Sensitive datasource parameters like passwords are encrypted before
being stored in the backend.

Before creating datasources containing sensitive parameters, make sure
you set a custom encryption key by running the
`+replace_encryption_key+` command:

[source,bash]
----
bin/investigate replace_encryption_key [options] <current_key> <new_key> <new_cipher>
----

* `+current_key+`: A base64 encoded string containing the current
encryption key.
* `+new_key+`: A base64 encoded string containing the new encryption
key.
* `+new_cipher+`: The cipher algorithm to use (currently only AES-GCM is
supported).

The current encryption key can be read from the `+investigate.yml+` file
in the `+datasource_encryption_key+` parameter.

Keys can have a length of 16, 24 or 32 bytes; a quick way to encode a
plaintext string to base64 is to use the `+base64+` utility from the
`+coreutils+` package:

[source,bash]
----
$ echo -n changemechangemechangemechangeme | base64
Y2hhbmdlbWVjaGFuZ2VtZWNoYW5nZW1lY2hhbmdlbWU=
----

NOTE: Make sure to set the configuration file as readable only by the user
running the Siren Investigate process.


=== Datasource entity selection

Selected Entities can be used as source of parameters for queries. Each
selected entity is uniquely identified by a URI:

`+INDEX/TYPE/ID+` where INDEX is an index pattern, TYPE is a type of
document, and ID is document ID.

As explained in the following sections, queries on external datasources
can extract variables from the selected entity URI; to enable the user
to select an entity, you must add a xref:visualizations.adoc#_record_table_visualization[Record Table] visualization to
a dashboard and configure at least one
link:/document/preview/60173#UUID-db904423-e774-d8ab-d0aa-711cae41f3e4[click
handler] to select an entity.

After the visualization is configured, clicking the cell will display a
purple box in the filter bar, and the variables stored in the entity URI
will be available to queries and query templates.

The following image shows the effect of clicking a cell configured with
an entity selection handler; after selecting an entity, the _Company
Info_ template viewer shows the information about the company fetched by
a query.

To switch off or cancel the selection, click the icons displayed inside
the entity selection widget when the mouse pointer is over it, as
displayed in following image:

*Queries*

Queries can be used to provide data to link:#[?xml_title],
link:#UUID-9c0be2e0-2099-d73c-791f-b4f2b843fa80[tag] and filter
Elasticsearch documents.

To create a new query, click to the _"Settings/Queries"_ tab.

You need then to set the following fields to define a query:

* _Title_: The title of the query.
* _Datasource_: The name of a configured datasource.
* _Results query_: The query declaration.

You may also set a description for the query and one or more tags.

The following is an example configuration of a query on a SQL database
called *Top 50 companies (HR count)* that returns the Top 50 companies
by number of employees in a table called `+company+`.

image:15d88ced2ab387.png[Configuration of a SQL endpoint]

The preview section will display the results of the query as a table or
as a JSON object.

NOTE: Template rendering is currently a blocking operation, therefore queries
returning many results may make the backend unresponsive for an
indeterminate amount of time.


=== Query variables

One of the most useful features of queries is that it is possible to set
some of their parameters before execution by using datasource specific
variables, which can be set at run time by configuring
link:/document/preview/60173#UUID-db904423-e774-d8ab-d0aa-711cae41f3e4[click
handlers] in the link:#[?xml_title] visualization to select an
entity.2.1.7.1 Click handlers

Variable values are taken from Elasticsearch document selected using
selected entity URI.

All properties from selected document can be accessed using the
following syntax:
_@doc[PATH_ELEMENT_1][PATH_ELEMENT_2]…[PATH_ELEMENT_N]@_

* to get the document id use: *@doc[_id]@*
* to get the value of property called *action* use:
*@doc[_source][action]@*
* to get the value of nested property called *person.age* use:
*@doc[_source][person][age]@*

To view the results of the query, you have to specify an entity URI
manually in the field on the top right;

The following is an example of configuration for a query named *Company
Info* using a variable to get the value of property called *id* of
currently selected entity In the example, _@doc[_source][id]@_ is
replaced with an id taken from selected company. In the Selected Entity
box we see that the selected company is from index: *company*, has a
type: *Company* and has the id *AVgfaYQ0Q2VQXwxDgyfY*

=== Activation query

An activation query can be specified to conditionally execute the
results query.

For example, if you have a table called _Vehicles_ but some queries are
only relevant to "Motorcycles" and not to "Cars", the activation query
could be used to determine if the results query should be executed when
an entity in _Vehicles_ by looking at its type. If the query is not
executed, any template or aggregator using the query will be
automatically switched off.

On SQL datasources, activation queries will trigger results query
execution when returning at least one record.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT id
FROM Vehicles
WHERE id='@doc[_source][id]@' AND vehicle_type='Motorcycle'
----

=== Use cases

After you have configured query templates and queries, you can use them
in the following visualizations:

* The link:#[?xml_title] visualization
* The link:#[?xml_title] visualization

It is also possible to use queries as aggregations as explained as
follows.

=== External query terms filters aggregation

The query results from an external datasource can be used as an
aggregation in visualizations.

This enables you to compute metrics on Elasticsearch documents _joined_
with query results.

To use a query as an aggregation, select a bucket type and select
External Query Terms Filter in the Aggregation box; then, click Add an
external query terms filter.

You can then configure how to join the query results with the
Elasticsearch documents by setting the following parameters:

* _Source query id_: The name of the query on the external datasource.
* _Source query variable_: The name of the variable in query results
which contains the first value used in the join.
* _Target field_: The name of the field in the target index which
contains the second value used in the join.

The aggregation will return only documents in the Elasticsearch index
whose target field value is equal to the source query variable value in
at least one of the results returned by the query; if _Negate the query_
is checked, the aggregation will return only documents in the
Elasticsearch index whose target field value is not equal to any of the
values of the source query variable in the results returned by the
query.

For example, the following image show the configuration of a Data table
visualization with three aggregations based on external queries:

* A query that selects the labels of the competitors of the currently
selected company.
* A query that selects the labels of all the companies which have a
competitor.
* A query that selects the IDs of the top 500 companies by number of
employees.

If a query requires a selected entity, and no entity is selected, the
computed aggregation will return 0, also the controls to select
*Selected entity* will indicate (red borders around) that it is
necessary to select one.
