= Discover

You can explore your data interactively from the Discover page. You have
access to every document in every index which matches the selected index
pattern. You can submit search queries, filter the search results, and
view document data. You can also see the number of documents that match
the search query and get field value statistics. If a time field is
configured for the selected index pattern, the distribution of documents
over time is displayed in a histogram at the top of the page.

image:15d88cec895134.png[Discover.]


== Setting the time filter

The time filter restricts the search results to a specific time period.
You can set a time filter if your index contains time-based events and a
time-field is configured for the selected index pattern.

Because of the variety of date formats in use, and the possibility that
an index is fixed to use a specific format, Siren provides sample valid
dates when editing filters.

By default, the time filter is set to the last 15 minutes. You can use
the Time Picker to change the time filter or select a specific time
interval or time range in the histogram at the top of the page.

To set a time filter with the Time Picker:

[arabic]
. Click *Time Picker* (image:15d88cec89d28c.png[image]) in the
Siren Investigate toolbar.
. To set a quick filter, click one of the shortcut links.
+
image:15d88cec8a4296.png[Time filter shortcuts.]
. Click Select All in the Apply to Dashboards section to apply the time
filter to all dashboards. Alternatively, you can select individual
dashboards. The time filter is applied to the current dashboard by
default.
. To specify a time filter relative to the current time, click Relative
and specify the start time as a number of seconds, minutes, hours, days,
months or years. You can also specify the end time relative to the
current time. Relative times can be in the past or the future.
+
image:15d88cec8ab24d.png[Relative time filter.]
. To specify both the start and end times for the time filter, click
Absolute and select a start and end date. You can adjust the time by
editing the To and From fields.
+
image:15d88cec8b6012.png[Absolute time filter.]
. Click the caret (image:15d88cec8bf71a.png[image]) in the bottom
right corner to close the Time Picker.

To set a time filter from the histogram, do one of the following:

* Click the bar that represents the time interval you want to zoom in
on.
* Click and drag to view a specific time span. You must start the
selection with the cursor over the background of the chart. The cursor
changes to a plus sign (*+*) when you move the mouse pointer over a
valid start point.

To move forward or backward in time, click the arrows to the left or
right of the Time Picker:

image:15d88cec8c6bcb.png[Move backwards in time.]

You can use your browser's Back button to undo your changes.

The displayed time range and interval are shown on the histogram. By
default, the interval is set automatically based on the time range. To
use a different interval, click the link and select an interval.


== Searching your data

You can search the indices that match the current index pattern by
entering your search criteria in the Query bar. You can perform a simple
text search, use the Lucene
https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html[query
syntax], or use the full JSON-based
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch
Query DSL].

When you submit a search request, the histogram, Documents table, and
Fields list are updated to reflect the search results. The total number
of hits (matching documents) is shown in the toolbar. The Documents
table shows the first five hundred hits. By default, the hits are listed
in reverse chronological order, with the newest documents shown first.
You can reverse the sort order by clicking the Time column header. You
can also sort the table by the values in any indexed field. For more
information, see <<Viewing document data>>.

To search your data, enter your search criteria in the Query bar and
press Enter or click Search (image:15d88cec8cf499.png[image]) to
submit the request to Elasticsearch.

* To perform a free text search, enter a text string. For example, if
you are searching web server logs, you could enter `+safari+` to search
all fields for the term `+safari+`.
* To search for a value in a specific field, prefix the value with the
name of the field. For example, you could enter `+status:200+` to find
all of the entries that contain the value `+200+` in the status field.
* To search for a range of values, you can use the bracketed range
syntax, `+[START_VALUE TO END_VALUE]+`. For example, to find entries
that have `+4xx+` status codes, you could enter `+status:[400 TO 499]+`.
* To specify more complex search criteria, you can use the Boolean
operators `+AND+`, `+OR+`, and `+NOT+`. For example, to find entries
that have `+4xx+` status codes and have an extension of `+php+` or
`+html+`, you could enter
`+status:[400 TO 499] AND (extension:php OR extension:html)+`.

NOTE: These examples use the Lucene query syntax. You can also submit queries
using the Elasticsearch Query DSL. For examples, see
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[query
string syntax] in the Elasticsearch Reference.


*Saving a search*

Saving searches enables you to reload them into Discover and use them as
the basis for
xref:visualizations.adoc[visualizations].
Saving a search saves both the search query string and the currently
selected index pattern.

To save the current search:

[arabic]
. Click *Save* in the Siren Investigate toolbar.
. Enter a name for the search and click Save.

You can import, export and remove saved searches from
[.menuchoice]#Management > Saved Objects#.

*Opening a saved search*

To load a saved search into Discover:

[arabic]
. Click Open in the Siren Investigate toolbar.
. Select the search you want to open.

If the saved search is associated with a different index pattern than is
currently selected, opening the saved search also changes the selected
index pattern.

*Changing which indices you are searching*

When you submit a search request, the indices that match the
currently-selected index pattern are searched. The current index pattern
is shown below the toolbar. To change which indices you are searching,
click the index pattern and select a different index pattern.

For more information about index patterns, see
xref:management.adoc#_index_pattern_searches[Creating an Index
Pattern Search].

*Refreshing the search results*

As more documents are added to the indices you are searching, the search
results shown in Discover and used to display visualizations get stale.
You can configure a refresh interval to periodically resubmit your
searches to retrieve the latest results.

To enable auto refresh:

[arabic]
. Click Time Picker (image:15d88cec89d28c.png[image]) in the Siren
Investigate toolbar.
. Click Auto refresh.
. Choose a refresh interval from the list.
+
image:15d88cec8d81f3.png[Auto refresh intervals.]

When auto refresh is enabled, the refresh interval is displayed next to
the Time Picker, together with a Pause button. To temporarily switch off
auto refresh, click Pause.

NOTE: If auto refresh is not enabled, you can manually refresh visualizations
by clicking Refresh.



== Filtering by field

You can filter the search results to display only those documents that
contain a particular value in a field. You can also create negative
filters that exclude documents that contain the specified field value.

You add field filters from the Fields list, the Documents table, or by
manually adding a filter. In addition to creating positive and negative
filters, the Documents table enables you to filter on whether or not a
field is present. The applied filters are shown below the Query bar.
Negative filters are shown in red.

To add a filter from the Fields list:

[arabic]
. Click the name of the field you want to filter on. This displays the
top five values for that field.
+
image:15d88cec8df54c.png[filter field]
. To add a positive filter, click *Positive Filter*
(image:15d88cec8e6362.png[image]). This includes only those
documents that contain that value in the field.
. To add a negative filter, click *Negative Filter*
(image:15d88cec8ed4ee.png[image]). This excludes documents that
contain that value in the field.

To add a filter from the Documents table:

[arabic]
. Expand a document in the Documents table by clicking *Expand*
(image:15d88cec900aef.png[image]) to the left of the documentâ€™s
table entry.
+
image:15d88cec90729e.png[Expanded Document]
. To add a positive filter, click *Positive Filter*
(image:15d88cec8e6362.png[image]) to the right of the field name.
This includes only those documents that contain that value in the field.
. To add a negative filter, click *Negative Filter*
(image:15d88cec8ed4ee.png[image]) to the right of the field name.
This excludes documents that contain that value in the field.
. To filter on whether or not documents contain the field, click
*Exists* (image:15d88cec910121.png[image]) to the right of the
field name. This includes only those documents that contain the field.

To manually add a filter:

[arabic]
. Click *Add Filter*. A popup will be displayed for you to create the
filter.
+
image:15d88cec917e30.png[Add filter.]
. Choose a field to filter by. This list of fields will include fields
from the index pattern you are currently querying against.
+
image:15d88cec91fab5.png[Add filter field.]
. Choose an operation for your filter.
+
image:15d88cec926f22.png[Add filter operator.]
+
The following operators can be selected:
+
[cols=",",]
|===
|`+is+` |Filter where the value for the field matches the given value.

|`+is not+` |Filter where the value for the field does not match the
given value.

|`+is one of+` |Filter where the value for the field matches one of the
specified values.

|`+is not one of+` |Filter where the value for the field does not match
any of the specified values.

|`+is between+` |Filter where the value for the field is in the given
range.

|`+is not between+` |Filter where the value for the field is not in the
given range.

|`+exists+` |Filter where any value is present for the field.

|`+does not exist+` |Filter where no value is present for the field.
|===
. Choose the value(s) for your filter.
+
image:15d88cec92e9c0.png[add filter value]
. (Optional) Specify a label for the filter. If you specify a label, it
will be displayed below the Query bar instead of the filter definition.
. Click *Save*. The filter will be applied to your search and be
displayed below the Query bar.

NOTE: To make the filter editor more user-friendly, you can enable the
`+filterEditor:suggestValues+` advanced setting. Enabling this will
cause the editor to suggest values from your indices if you are
filtering against an aggregatable field. However, this is not
recommended for extremely large data sets, as it can result in long
queries.


*Managing filters*

To modify a filter, move the moue pointer over it and click one of the
action buttons.

image:15d88cec936270.png[Filter action buttons.]

image:15d88cec93e083.png[image] Enable Filter::
  Switch off the filter without removing it. Click again to switch the
  filter on again. Diagonal stripes indicate that a filter is switched
  off.
image:15d88cec945cda.png[image] Pin Filter::
  Pin the filter. Pinned filters persist when you switch contexts in
  Siren Investigate. For example, you can pin a filter in Discover and
  it remains in place when you switch to Visualize. Note that a filter
  is based on a particular index fieldâ€”if the indices being searched do
  not contain the field in a pinned filter, it has no effect.
image:15d88cec8ed4ee.png[image] Invert Filter::
  Switch from a positive filter to a negative filter and vice-versa.
image:15d88cec94ce8f.png[image] Remove Filter::
  Remove the filter.
image:15d88cec95789d.png[image] Edit Filter::
  <<Filtering by field,Edit the filter>>
  definition. Enables you to manually update the filter and specify a
  label for the filter.

To apply a filter action to all the applied filters, click *Actions* and
select the action.

*Editing a filter*

You can edit a filter by changing the field, operator, or value
associated with the filter (see the *Add Filter* section), or by
directly modifying the filter query that is performed to filter your
search results. This enables you to create more complex filters that are
based on multiple fields.

[arabic]
. To edit the filter query, first click *Edit* for the filter, then
click *Edit Query DSL*.
+
image:15d88cec95fd74.png[Edit filter query.]
. You can then edit the query for the filter.
+
image:15d88cec966904.png[Edit filter query JSON.]

For example, you could use a
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-bool-query.html[bool
query] to create a filter for the sample log data that displays the hits
that originated from Canada or China that resulted in a 404 error:

[source,json]
----
{
  "bool": {
    "should": [
      {
        "term": {
          "geoip.country_name.raw": "Canada"
        }
      },
      {
        "term": {
          "geoip.country_name.raw": "China"
        }
      }
    ],
    "must": [
      {
        "term": {
          "response": "404"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----


== Viewing document data

When you submit a search query, the 500 most recent documents that match
the query are listed in the Documents table. You can configure the
number of documents shown in the table by setting the
`+discover:sampleSize+` property in
link:#UUID-7a1137ad-07bd-6f5d-341c-c20924eba37b[Advanced Settings]. By
default, the table shows the localized version of the time field
configured for the selected index pattern and the document `+_source+`.
You can
link:#UUID-7712c1b9-4a9b-1f1d-4456-aac12e622e6d_adding-columns[add
fields to the Documents table] from the Fields list. You can
link:#UUID-7712c1b9-4a9b-1f1d-4456-aac12e622e6d_sorting[sort the listed
documents] by any indexed field thatâ€™s included in the table.

To view a documentâ€™s field data, click *Expand*
(image:15d88cec900aef.png[image]) to the left of the documentâ€™s
table entry.

image:15d88cec90729e.png[Expanded Document]

To view the original JSON document (pretty-printed), click the *JSON*
tab.

To view the document data as a separate page, click the *View single
document* link. You can bookmark and share this link to provide direct
access to a particular document.

To display or hide a fieldâ€™s column in the Documents table, click Toggle
column in table (image:15d88cec96f6ac.png[image]).

To collapse the document details, click *Collapse*
(image:15d88cec975de7.png[image]).

*Sorting the document list*

You can sort the documents in the Documents table by the values in any
indexed field. If a time field is configured for the current index
pattern, the documents are sorted in reverse chronological order by
default.

To change the sort order, move the mouse pointer over the name of the
field you want to sort by and click the sort button. Click again to
reverse the sort order.

*Adding field columns to the documents table*

By default, the Documents table shows the localized version of the time
field thatâ€™s configured for the selected index pattern and the document
`+_source+`. You can add fields to the table from the Fields list or
from a documentâ€™s field data.

To add a field column from the Fields list, move the mouse pointer over
the field and click its *add* button.

image:15d88cec97d3e6.png[Add Field From Sidebar]

To add a field column from a documentâ€™s field data, expand the document
and click the fieldâ€™s *Toggle column in table*
(image:15d88cec96f6ac.png[image]) button.

Added field columns replace the `+_source+` column in the Documents
table. The added fields are also added to the
<<Selected fields>> list.

To rearrange the field columns, move the mouse pointer over the header
of the column you want to move and click the *Move left* or *Move right*
button.

image:15d88cec984791.png[Move column.]

*Removing field columns from the documents table*

To remove a field column from the Documents table, move the mouse
pointer over the header of the column you want to remove and click
*Remove* (image:15d88cec98c2a7.png[image]).


== Viewing document context

For certain applications it can be useful to inspect a window of
documents surrounding a specific event. The context view enables you to
do just that for index patterns that are configured to contain
time-based events.

To show the context surrounding an anchor document, click *Expand*
(image:15d88cec900aef.png[image]) to the left of the documentâ€™s
table entry and then click the *View surrounding documents* link.

image:15d88cec90729e.png[Expanded document.]

The context view displays a number of documents before and after the
anchor document. The anchor document itself is highlighted in blue. The
view is sorted by the time field specified in the index pattern
configuration and uses the same set of columns as the Discover view the
context was opened from. If there are multiple documents with the same
time field value, the internal document order is used as a secondary
sorting criterion by default.

NOTE: The field used for tie breaking in case of equal time field values can
be configured using the advanced setting `+context:tieBreakerFields+`
inÂ [.menuchoice]#Management > Advanced Settings#, which defaults to the
`+_doc+` field. The value of this setting can be a comma-separated list
of field names, which will be checked in sequence for suitability when a
context is about to be displayed. The first suitable field is then used
as the tie breaking field. A field is suitable if the field exists and
is sortable in the index pattern the context is based on.

While not required, you should only use fields which have
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/doc-values.html[doc
values] enabled to achieve good performance and avoid unnecessary
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modules-fielddata.html[field
data] usage. Common examples for suitable fields include log line
numbers, monotonically increasing counters and high-precision
timestamps.


image:15d88cec992e78.png[Context view.]

NOTE: The number of documents displayed by default can be configured using the
`+context:defaultSize+` setting in [.menuchoice]#Management > Advanced
Settings#.



=== Changing the context size

You can change the number documents displayed before and after the
anchor document independently.

To increase the number of displayed documents that are newer than the
anchor document, click *Load 5 more* above the document list or enter
the desired number into the input box.

image:15d88cec999ba5.png[image]

To increase the number of displayed documents that are older than the
anchor document, click *Load 5 more* below the document list or enter
the desired number into the input box

image:15d88cec9a0014.png[image]

NOTE: The default number of documents loaded with each click can be configured
using the `+context:step+` setting in ManagementAdvanced Settings.



=== Filtering the context

Depending on how the documents are partitioned into index patterns, the
context view may contain many documents not related to the event under
investigation. To adapt the focus of the context view to the task at
hand, you can use filters to restrict the documents considered by Siren
Investigate for display in the context view.

When switching from the Discover view to the Context view, the
previously applied filters are carried over. Pinned filters remain
active while normal filters are copied in a switched off state. You can
selectively re-enabled them to refine your context view.

New filters can be added using the *Add a filter* link in the filter
bar, by clicking the filter icons appearing when moving the mouse
pointer over a field, or by expanding documents and clicking the filter
icons in the table.

image:15d88cec9a75ec.png[Discover context view filter montage.]


== Viewing field data statistics

From the Fields list, you can see how many of the documents in the
Documents table contain a particular field, what the top five values
are, and what percentage of documents contain each value.

To view field data statistics, click the name of a field in the Fields
list.

image:15d88cec8df54c.png[Field statistics.]


== Selected fields

Selected Fields are displayed on the *Selected Field* list at the top
left of the Discover page.

image:15d88cec9af311.png[Selected fields.]

Click a field to see the fieldâ€™s
link:#UUID-ac810a06-5435-f7dd-1b4e-1bf44e6cda59[stats].

To remove a field, click the field and click *Remove*.

image:15d88cec9b6cfb.png[Remove selected field.]

After you have selected at least one field, you can then click *Generate
Dashboard* to begin auto generating a new
xref:dashboard.adoc[Dashboard].

If you have not selected any fields, you can allow Siren Investigate to
select the fields it believes are the most relevant by clicking
*Autoselect Most Relevant*.

NOTE: This button is only visible if there are no fields selected. If you have
selected fields, the *Generate Dashboard* button will be visible in its
place.



=== Auto select fields

Siren Investigate begins testing the fields with each field being
analyzed for relevance against a number of heuristics, for example,
whether all values are unique - which indicates a potential ID field and
unlikely to be relevant for visualizations.

image:15d88cec9bd40c.png[Auto select report.]

After all the fields have been analyzed, a test report is displayed.

image:15d88cec9c6287.png[Auto select report.]

This report shows all the fields in the Discover data, which fields are
selected as most relevant, the field type, the visualization selected
for that type, the relevancy score and any notes on why the field was or
was not selected as a relevant field.

You can add and remove fields you would like selected using the check
boxes on the left.

When you are ready, click *Ok* to select the fields.

After the fields have populated the *Selected Fields* list, you are
ready to xref:dashboard.adoc#_auto_generate_dashboard[generate a
dashboard].
