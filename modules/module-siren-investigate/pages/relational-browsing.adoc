= Relational browsing

Siren Investigate enables you to _filter_ documents on a dashboard by
showing only those that have a relation with documents displayed on a
different dashboard, possibly stored in different indices.



== Relational Navigator

The Relational Navigator component typically requires no configuration.
It automatically discovers all possible destinations based on
relationships between indices defined in the [.menuchoice]##Management > Data Model##
tab.

It can be reused across any dashboard (there is no need to create
different ones for different dashboards).

Each dashboard has an associated "Saved Search" which is based on an
underlying Index Pattern. If the index patterns underlying two
dashboards have a relational connection, this relationship will be shown
by the Relational Navigator, by default.

It is really much simpler than it sounds. Drop this component into a
dashboard which is associated with a Saved Search and it will show you
all the possible relational connections with other dashboards which have
related entities.

NOTE: The relational filter visualization requires

=== Index to index relations

When two entities are directly connected

For example, let’s take the following indices:

[cols=",",]
|===
|_article_ |an index containing articles; each document in the index has
a field called `+companies+` which is an array that contains the ID of
companies mentioned in the article. This index is displayed on the
dashboard entitled `+Articles+`.

|_company_ |an index containing information about companies; each
document in the index has a field called `+id+` that contains the ID of
the company. This index is displayed on the dashboard entitled
`+Companies+`.
|===

Both indices are
link:/document/preview/60589#UUID-bd72e06e-719f-faa2-d706-bcc68b2931af[configured]
so that they are joined on the field `+companies+` of `+article+` with
the field `+id+` of `+company+`. Then, it is possible to use that
configuration to create a relational filter that would filter companies
based on connected articles (or vice-versa).3.9.2. Relations (legacy)

In the _Articles_ dashboard, the relational navigator visualization is
displayed as a button which indicates the number of documents in the
_Companies_ dashboard that are mentioned in the articles of the current
dashboard.

The following image shows the button for the relation described in the
example; there are two possible locations from 646,896 articles
currently displayed

* 18508 companies on `+all companies+` dashboard
* Two companies on `+Companies timeline analysis+` dashboard

dashboard]

Clicking the first button will switch you to the _Companies_ dashboard
and display the 18508 companies; the relational filter is displayed in
the filter bar:

Companies dashboard]



=== Index to entity Identifier relations

When two entities are connected using Entity Identifier

For example, let’s take the following indices:

[cols=",",]
|===
|_company_ |an index containing information about companies; each
document in the index has a field called `+city+` that contains the name
of the city this company is located in

|_investor_ |an index containing articles; each document in the index
has a field called `+city+` that contains the name of the city this
investor is located in

|_city_ |an entity identifier which represent the concept of a city
|===

There is no direct relation between investor and company but thanks to
the city entity identifier the Relational Navigator is able to join the
two. The following image shows a light-blue button for a relation using
entity identifier described previously.

dashboard]

There are two possible locations using `+is located in+` relation from
15k investors currently displayed

* 54028 companies on `+all companies+` dashboard
* 3 companies on `+Companies timeline analysis+` dashboard


==== Ordering

Click *Order* (image:15d88ced236d3e.png[image]) to switch the
ordering

There are two possible ways to navigate the tree of possible
destinations, we can order by:

dashboards - where you first see the relation and then the destination
dashboards

image:15d88ced23d435.png[Order by dashboards first]

relations - where you first see the destination dashboards and then
which relation you can reach it with

image:15d88ced243b6f.png[Order by relation first]

*Configuration*

All possible relations are discovered automatically.

==== Hierarchy types (layout)

There are two possible values:

Normal - the entity identifiers subtree layout is EIDs → relations →
dashboards or EID → dashboards → relations

Light - the entity identifiers subtree layout is collapsed into EIDs →
relations → dashboards or EID → dashboards → relations

The following image shows the `+Light+` layout activated

image:15d88ced2559ae.png[ Relational Navigator settings, layout ]


==== Visibility

In the component setting, one can change the visibility status of each
individual connection at multiple levels.

The three state eye component enables you to specify "never show",
"always show" or "inherit show from the previous".

User can restrict which destinations are visible by clicking the
`+eyes+` symbols next to listed destinations

For example, lets hide one company dashboard destination when we are on
"articles" index

image:15d88ced25c364.png[Relational Navigator settings, hide one
destination]

As we can see now the `+Companies timeline analysis+` is no longer
displayed on Articles dashboard

dashboard, one destination hidden]
