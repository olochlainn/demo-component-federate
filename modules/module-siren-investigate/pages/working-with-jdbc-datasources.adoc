= Working with JDBC datasources

Siren Investigate can analyze data by directly querying remote JDBC
datasources using the Siren Federate plugin.

To create dashboards on JDBC datasources you must:

* Prepare the Federate plugin to connect to your datasource.
* Configure the connection to the datasource from Siren Investigate.
* Create virtual indices for your tables.

You can then configure index patterns on your virtual indices, display
them in Discover and configure dashboards and visualizations for the
supported aggregations. For more information, see the supported
aggregations section in
xref:module-siren-federate:connector-apis.adoc[Connector
APIs].

== Siren Federate plugin configuration

For more information on using external JDBC datasources, see
xref:module-siren-federate:introduction.adoc[Siren
Federate].

== Neo4j datasources

Neo4j is a _graph database_, and does not serve data in the way that a
conventional relational database does. However, Siren Investigate
interacts with Neo4j datasources through the JDBC connector. For more
details, see xref:data-reflection.adoc#_integrating_neo4j_data[Integrating
Neo4j data].


== Siren Investigate datasource configuration

Open Siren Investigate in your browser, then go to
[.menuchoice]#Management > Datasources#.

In the New datasource type box, select JDBC.

The datasource configuration supports the following parameters:

* `+Database name+`: The name of the default database / catalog on the
remote datasource (usually optional).
* `+Datasource name+`: The name of the datasource (for example
`+mysql-sales+`)
* `+Driver class+`: The JDBC driver class name (for example
`+com.mysql.jdbc.Driver+`)
* `+Username+` and `+Password+`: The credentials of the user that will
be used by the plugin to open connections.
* `+Timezone+`: If date and timestamp fields are stored in a timezone
different that UTC, specifying this parameter will instruct the plugin
to convert dates and times to/from the specified timezone when
performing queries and retrieving results.
* `+Connection string+`: The JDBC connection string; see
xref:module-siren-federate:connecting-to-jdbc-datasources.adoc#_jdbc_driver_installation_and_compatibility[JDBC
driver installation and compatibility] for information about
database-specific connection string parameters.JDBC driver installation
and compatibility

Enter the required parameters, then click Save in the top right corner.

Click Test Connection. If the settings are correctly configured a
confirmation dialog is displayed:

Click Yes, take me there to map a table from the database to a virtual
index:

The virtual index configuration supports the following parameters:

* `+Datasource name+`: The name of an existing datasource.
* `+Resource name+`: The name of a table or view on the remote
datasource.
* `+Virtual index name+`: The name of the virtual index; this must be a
valid lowercase Elasticsearch index name. You should start virtual
indices with a common prefix to simplify handling of permissions.
* `+Primary key+`: The name of a unique column. If a virtual index has
no primary key it will be possible to perform aggregations, however
visualizations that require a unique identifier such as the graph
browser will not work with the index.
* `+Catalog+` and `+Schema+`: The catalog and schema containing the
table specified before; these are usually required only if the
connection does not specify a default catalog or schema.
* `+Search fields+`: An optional list of field names that will be
searched using the LIKE operator when processing queries written in the
search bar.

After the virtual index is configured, click Save in the top right
corner. Click Yes take me there to create an index pattern search
pointing to the virtual index.

Click Create Index Pattern Search and enter the same name used for the
Virtual Index, in this example *indexfromdb*, and clickÂ Create.

From this point, the *indexfromdb* index pattern search can be used in
Discover, Visualize and so on.
