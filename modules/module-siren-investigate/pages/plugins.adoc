= Plugins

Add-on functionality for Siren Investigate/Kibana is implemented with
plugin modules. You can use the `+bin/investigate-plugin+` command to
manage these modules. You can also install a plugin manually by moving
the plugin file to the `+plugins+` folder and unpacking the plugin files
into a new folder.

Generally Kibana plugins are compatible with Siren Investigate provided
the plugin is compatible with the Kibana version mentioned in the
*Management* section.

IMPORTANT: The Kibana plugin interfaces are in a state of constant development. We
cannot provide backwards compatibility for plugins due to the high rate
of change. Kibana enforces that the installed plugins match the version
of Kibana itself. Plugin developers will have to release a new version
of their plugin for each new Kibana release as a result.



== Installing plugins

Use the following command to install a plugin:

[source,shell]
----
bin/investigate-plugin install <package name or URL>
----

When you specify a plugin name without a URL, the plugin tool attempts
to download an official Elastic plugin, such as:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/investigate-plugin install x-pack
----

=== Installing plugins from an arbitrary URL

You can download official Elastic plugins by specifying their name. You
can alternatively specify a URL to a specific plugin, as in the
following example:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/investigate-plugin install https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/packs/x-pack/x-pack-10.0.0.zip
----

You can specify URLs that use the HTTP, HTTPS, or `+file+` protocols.

=== Installing plugins to an arbitrary folder

Use the `+-d+` or `+--plugin-dir+` option after the `+install+` command
to specify a folder for plugins, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/investigate-plugin install file:///some/local/path/x-pack.zip -d path/to/folder
----

NOTE: This command creates the specified folder if it does not already exist.



=== Installing plugins with Linux packages

The Siren Investigate server must be able to write to files in the
`+optimize+` folder. If you are installing plugins using `+sudo+` or
`+su+` you must ensure these commands are run as the user `+myuser+`.
This user is already added for you as part of the package installation.

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo -u myuser bin/investigate-plugin install x-pack
----

If plugins were installed as a different user and the server is not
starting, then you must change the owner of these files:

[source,shell]
----
$ chown -R myuser:myuser /path/to/siren-investigate/optimize
----


== Updating and removing plugins

To update a plugin, remove the current version and reinstall the plugin.

To remove a plugin, use the `+remove+` command, as in the following
example:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/investigate-plugin remove
----

You can also remove a plugin manually by deleting the plugin’s subfolder
under the `+plugins/+` folder.

NOTE: Removing a plugin will result in an "optimize" run which will delay the
next start of Siren Investigate.




== Switching off plugins

Use the following command to switch off a plugin:

[source,shell]
----
./bin/investigate --<plugin ID>.enabled=false 
----

NOTE: Switching a plugin on or off will result in an "optimize" run which will
delay the start of Siren Investigate.


* You can find a plugin’s plugin ID as the value of the `+name+`
property in the plugin’s `+package.json+` file.


== Configuring the plugin manager

By default, the plugin manager provides you with feedback on the status
of the activity you have asked the plugin manager to perform. You can
control the level of feedback with the `+--quiet+` and `+--silent+`
options. Use the `+--quiet+` option to suppress all non-error output.
Use the `+--silent+` option to suppress all output.

By default, plugin manager requests do not time out. Use the
`+--timeout+` option, followed by a time, to change this behavior, as in
the following examples:

*Wait 30 seconds before failing*

....
bin/investigate plugin --install username/sample-plugin --timeout 30s
....

*Wait one minute before failing*

[source,shell]
----
bin/investigate plugin --install username/sample-plugin --timeout 1m
----

=== Plugins and custom Siren Investigate configurations

Use the `+-c+` or `+--config+` options to specify the path to the
configuration file used to start Siren Investigate. By default, Siren
Investigate uses the configuration file `+config/investigate.yml+`. When
you change your installed plugins, the `+bin/investigate plugin+`
command restarts the Siren Investigate server. When you are using a
customized configuration file, you must specify the path to that
configuration file each time you use the `+bin/investigate plugin+`
command.
