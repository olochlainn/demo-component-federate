= Siren ER (beta)

Siren ER (beta) is an AI-powered feature that enables entity resolutionâ€”the ability to recognize that records across different tables and datasources, using different schemas and even in different languages are in fact referring to the same entity (which could be a person, company, or any other thing). Siren ER (beta) can remove ambiguity and reveal previously hidden relationships in the data.

Siren ER (beta) is currently implemented as a Docker installation; instructions for using it are available at https://support.siren.io/support/solutions/articles/17000092368-siren-er.
