= Federation of External Databases

Siren Federate provides a module, called "`Connector`", which transparently maps external database systems
to "`Virtual Indices`" in Elasticsearch. Requests to the Elasticsearch APIs, such as the `Mapping` or `Search` APIs, are
intercepted by the Connector module. These requests are translated to the external database dialect and executed
against the external database. This enables Siren Investigate to create and
display dashboards for data located in external databases as if they were Elasticsearch's indices.
