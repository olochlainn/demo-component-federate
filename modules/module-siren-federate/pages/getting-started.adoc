= Getting Started

In this short guide, you will learn how you can quickly install the Siren Federate plugin in Elasticsearch,
load two collections of documents inter-connected by a common attribute, and execute a relational query across
the two collections within the Elasticsearch environment.

== Prerequisites

This guide requires that you have downloaded and
installed the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch {elasticsearch-version}] distribution
on your computer. If you do not have an Elasticsearch distribution, you can run the following
commands:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----------------------------------------------------------
$ wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{elasticsearch-version}.zip
$ unzip elasticsearch-{elasticsearch-version}.zip
$ cd elasticsearch-{elasticsearch-version}
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you plan to use `{sg}` for securing your cluster, then you need to download the Apache-licensed Elasticsearch bundle instead at https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss-{elasticsearch-version}.zip.
