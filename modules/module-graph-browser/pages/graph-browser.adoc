= Graph Browser

Graph Browser is a visualization that displays Elasticsearch documents as nodes and Siren
Investigate relations as links of a graph.

NOTE: Because of Graph Browser's special features, it has its own section in the documentation. All other visualizations are described in the xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc[Visualizations] section.

== Configuration

=== Big nodes threshold

If a node would expand into more than this configured number of nodes it
will be considered a big node and the user will be given a choice to
proceed or to select a sample.

image:15d88cecc0d3e5.png[Big Nodes Handling]

=== Relations

You can configure the ontology relations you want to use in this
visualization. If no relation gets set, they will all be used.

=== Scripts 

The Graph Browser supports three types of scripts:

* *Expansion*: Used to customize the expansion policy. The provided one
(`+Default Expansion Policy+`) will retrieve the first level connected
elements to the expanded nodes
* *Contextual*: Displayed in the contextual menu (shown with a
`+RIGHT CLICK+`). Enable you to perform operations on the graph.
Provided _contextual_ scripts:
** *Expand by relation*: Opens a popup that enables you to choose one or
more of the available relations and expands the selected elements using
only the selected ones. This does not override the graph browser
configuration. You will see only the configured relations (if available
for the selected nodes).
** *Expand by top comention*: For use with `+company+` nodes from the
Siren demonstration data. This script expands the selected nodes using
an Elasticsearch aggregation to get the top comentioned `+company+`
nodes.
** *Replace investment with edge*: For use with the Siren demonstration
data. This script replaces the investment nodes with a direct link
between the company nodes and the investor nodes.
** *Select - All*: Select all the elements (equivalent
to [.keycombo]#Ctrl+A#).
** *Select - By edge count*: Select nodes based on their link count. You
can specify the count through the popup that appears.
** *Select - By type*: Select nodes based on their type. You can specify
the type through the popup that appears.
** *Select - Extend*: Extends the current selection to the sibling
elements.
** *Select - Invert*: Inverts the current selection.
** *Shortest Path*: Calculates the shortest path between two selected
nodes by fetching the connected elements. See the
<<_shortest_path_limitations,limitations for this
script>>.
** *Show nodes count by type*: Shows a popup with information about how
many nodes per type are currently displayed.
* *Lenses*:Lenses mutate the visual appearance of graph nodes and edges,
can be cascaded as well as switched on and off at will during
investigation. Provided _lens_ scripts:
** *Size lens*: Set the size for all nodes using an expression.
** *Color lens*: Define color for all nodes using a field.
** *Conditional lens*: Set node properties using expressions.
** *Label lens*: Set the label for all nodes using an expression.
** *Associate records based on ontology lens*: Replaces a node with
associated records based on ontology.
** *Time and location lens*: Set time and location properties.
* *On Update*: Modify the graph when new nodes are inserted. They can be
cascaded. Provided _on update_ scripts:
** *Add time fields*: Adds the time field used by the _timebar mode_.
** *Add geo-locations for map visualization*: Adds the geographic field
used by the _map mode_.
** *Replace investment with edge*: Similar to the _contextual_ script
`+Replace investment with edge+`, but executed automatically after every
expansion.
** *Signal dead companies*: Colors all the _company_ nodes that have a
`+deadpooled_date+` black.

To create a new _script_ go to `+Management+` → `+Scripts+`

image:15d88cecc15a9f.png[Scripts Management]

Here you can configure new _scripts_ or modify the saved ones.

=== Fields to exclude

You can configure a set of fields for each entity that you do not want
to retrieve. Typically, you will exclude large fields that do not
contribute to the link analysis (for example large textual blobs,
technical metadata)for extra performance.

== Navigating the Graph

After your Graph Browser visualization is ready, you can start your
investigations.

=== Toolbar

You have several operations available:

image:15d88cecc1e641.png[Toolbar]

[arabic]
. *Undo*: By default, the Graph Browser saves the last five states. With
this function you can go back one step at a time, until there are no
more available. You can configure the steps number in
[.menuchoice]#Management > Advanced Settings#.
. *Redo*: Revert an undo. Note, if you undo and then perform any
operation, the redo state will be lost.
. *Filter*: Add a filter to the current dashboard synchronized with the
graph selection. This enables you to:
* Do your investigation on the graph, select the vertices you are
interested into, activate the filter, pin it and go back to the related
dashboard to get more detailed information about those vertices.
* If you have other visualizations in the same dashboard, it will let
you have more information on the selected nodes. For example, if you
have the current dashboard associated with a companies saved search, you
can do your investigation in the graph, activate the filter, select some
vertices and get the visualizations to show information on the selected
vertices.
. *Crop*: Removes every element that is not selected
. *Remove*: Removes all the selected elements. Next to the _Remove_
button there is a box that shows the *Remove All* button. This will
remove the entire graph, regardless of selected elements.
+
image:15d88cecc25158.png[Remove all]
. *Expand*: Expands the currently selected nodes. Next to the _expand_
button, there is a box that shows advanced options for the expansion.
. *Highlight mode*: This toggles the _Highlight mode_. The _Highlight
mode_ moves everything to the background that is not selected or
connected to a selected node or link.
+
image:15d88cecc2c400.png[Highlighting on]
+
image:15d88cecc35dad.png[Highlighting off]
. *Layouts*: Enables you to change the current graph’s layout or redraw
the current layout:
* *Standard* (default): Selected nodes preserve their relative position.
* *Hierarchy*: Nodes are displayed top down according to their
connections. Requires at least one selected node to work. Selected nodes
will be moved at the top of the hierarchy.
+
image:15d88cecc3cdf3.gif[Standard layout]
+
image:15d88cecc4f676.gif[Hierarchy layout]
. *Add*: Opens a dialog with the following options:
* *Selected document*: Add the currently selected document. You can see
your selected document in the upper right purple selection box.
* *Saved graph*: Opens a dialog showing the available saved graphs. This
feature adds a set of nodes and links, but does not preserve the layout
you had when you saved the graph.
* *Manual Entity identifier*: Select an Entity identifier to add as a
node.
* *Dashboard*: Select a dashboard from the list to add it to the graph.
+
NOTE: You can also drag a dashboard from the Dashboard menu on the left and
drop it onto the graph.

+
image:15d88cecc5ace5.png[Add from saved graph]

. *Map Mode*: This toggles the _Map mode_. The _Map mode_ will move the
nodes geographically on an interactive map. You must set up a script to
configure the geographic properties of the nodes (See
<<Graph Browser>>).
+
image:15d88cecc62fa4.png[Map mode]
. *Timebar Mode*: This toggles the _Timebar mode_. This mode displays a
time bar at the bottom of the graph browser that enables time based
filtering of nodes. After you enable this mode you can add or remove
node types to the time bar:
+
image:15d88cecc6b1bf.png[Timebar filter]
+
You must set up a script to configure the time property of the nodes
(See <<Graph Browser>>).
+
image:15d88cecc7204b.png[Timebar mode]
. *Save graph*: Save the current graph.
+
image:15d88cecc796b3.png[Save graph]
. *Open graph*: Open a saved graph. Unlike _add from saved graph_, this
feature preserves the saved graph layout.
+
image:15d88cecc7fbe0.png[Open Graph]

=== Shortcuts

The Graph Browser supports shortcuts:

* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+A#: Select every element in the graph.
* Del: Remove the selected elements (equivalent to the remove button).
* [.keycombo]#Ctrl+click#: Enables you to add elements to the current
selection. Can also be used to create an OR filter from a selection.
* Double-click: Expands the selected nodes (equivalent to the
expandbutton)
* `+Arrows+`: Move the selected elements in the input direction.
* Mouse wheel: Changes the zoom level of the graph.

=== Navigation bar

image:15d88cecc86fc9.png[Navigation bar]

The navigation bar enables you to:

[arabic]
. Move the graph view in the clicked direction.
. Switch between:
* *Arrow*: Enables you to select elements.
* *Hand*: Enables you to move the graph regardless of selected elements.
. Enables you to change the zoom level.

=== Side bar

image:15d88cecc8dcd6.png[Side bar]

The side bar enables you to:

* Show, search, filter, sort, group and change node/links data.
* Change the current selection.
* Change node/links attributes (i.e: Color, label, tool tip, and so on).

== Lenses tab

image:15d88cecc9558f.png[Side bar lenses tab]

The lenses tab enables you to make alterations on the displayed
nodes/links:

* Color: Enables you to select a field which is then used to color the
nodes using a coloring schema.
* Conditional: Enables you to change a node property value using
configurable expressions.
* Label: Enables you to set the node label using an expression.
* Size: Use a log scale to adjust the node’s size according to an
expression.
* Spatio-Temporal: Enables you to set the node time and/or geographic
location from field values.
* Associate records based on ontology: Enables you to replace a node
with a relation between two of its children.
* Graph metric: Enables you to apply metrics to the graph including:
** Betweenness
** Closeness
** Connectiveness
** Degrees
** Eigenvector
** Pagerank

See <<Graph Browser>> for more information on lens expressions.

*Lens parameters*

image:15d88cecc9cdcf.png[Lens parameters]

Each lens has specific parameters which will be used for every graph
node.

*Conditional lens*

image:15d88cecca3b88.png[Conditional lens]

A conditional lens can change a property for all the nodes that satisfy
the condition:

* Color
* Node font icon
* Node glyphs
* Hidden
* Label
* Location
* Node image
+
NOTE: Node icons that link to web images are not always shown properly due to
security restrictions. You may need to configure the
xref:image-proxy-ip.adoc[Image Proxy] feature to
display them.

* Size
* Time
* Tooltip

*Associate records based on ontology lens*

image:15d88ceccab8be.png[Side bar - associate records based on
ontology lens]

The `+associate records based on ontology+` lens can use the node’s
underlying model, as in the following example, to replace a node with
the relation between two of its children.

*Investment model graph view*

image:15d88ceccb4ef6.png[Investment model graph view]

After you configure the lens, two nodes and its relationship will be
displayed. For example, apply this lens an investment node:

image:15d88ceccbdd18.png[Investment node]

You could obtain the associate records based on ontology as a result:

image:15d88ceccc60a4.png[Associate records based on ontology
result]

*Expansion tab*

The expansion tab controls how nodes expand when you double-click them
or select a group of nodes and click Expand.

* Dashboard filters: Restrict nodes produced by an expansion to those
present in the selected dashboard.
* Relations - simple: Restrict nodes produced by an expansion to the
selected relations.
* Relations - aggregated: Quickly show aggregates on graph edges that
summarize groups of intermediate nodes.

**Selection tab**

image:15d88ceccd4017.png[Selection tab]

The selection tab enables you to show, search, filter, sort, group and
change node/links data. When this tab is opened, it reacts with your
current node selection and loads the data in rows and columns.

The main component is the data grid, every grid’s row represents a node
in the graph and every column a field data related information.

*Document type selection*

The *Main selection* combo box enables selection between the different
document types in the selected nodes.

*Selection change*

The second column in the grid enables multiple row selection, once
selected it will reflect on the graph turning each node bigger and
changing the node’s border to red.

After you complete the selection, you can click the *Make main
selection* button floating over the grid to remove the non-selected
nodes.

*Global filter*

Typing in the *Filter* input enables you to search/filter in all rows
and columns.

*Local filter*

Typing inside of one column’s input enables you to search/filter in all
rows of that column.

*Grid menu*

image:15d88ceccdd0aa.png[Grid menu]

This menu enables you to show or hide columns and clear all local
filters.

*Column menu*

image:15d88cecce3eaf.png[Column menu]

The menu options enable you to:

* Change the sort order -Multiple column order is supported by keeping
shift key pressed on column selection-.
* Hide the column.
* Group the data.
* Add aggregated function, the result of which will be displayed at the
bottom.
* Pin the column to the left or right side of the grid.

*Lens Expressions*

Siren Investigate’s lens expression parser is based on
https://github.com/TomFrost/Jexl[Jexl].

The expression created within the lens is applied to each node of the
selection. Each node contains an object named `+payload+` which contains
the node’s data returned from Elasticsearch.


== Saving the Graph Browser configuration

The Graph Browser panel allows the user to change configurations through
the sidebar on the right. In the three tabs of the sidebar, the user can
change Lenses, Expansions, and Selections.

In the Lenses tab, you can add lenses, change the selected lens, remove
one or more lenses, and modify lens settings.

In the Expansions tab, you can check/uncheck the dashboard filters,
check/uncheck the simple and the aggregated relations filters, and
change aggregated relations options.

In the Selection tab, the selected graph items are shown in a grid; you
can hide columns, sort rows in a different order, by type and so on.

When a configuration is modified, a Save button appears in the top right
of the sidebar.

// This graphic consists of three files side by side.


[cols=", ,",]
|===
|image:15d8b8ddb542ae.png[image] |image:15d8b8ddb5874a.png[image] |image:15d8b8ddb5d491.png[image]
|===


If you switch to another dashboard without saving, and come back to the
Graph Browser, the sidebar state remains the same: all configuration
changes are kept and the Save button is still highlighted. In addition,
the sidebar width and state (opened or closed) are kept. If you leave
the session (log out) without saving the configurations, the next time
you log in and open the Graph Browser, the configurations will be lost.

If click the Save button, the current configurations are saved in the
uiStateJSON of the saved visualizations object related to the Graph
Browser visualization.

image:15d88cecd0ed04.png[image]

The structure of the saved JSON enables different configurations for the
Graph Browser in different dashboards. All the configurations are stored
under an id related to the dashboard id.

*Cloning a Graph Browser dashboard*

On the Graph Browser dashboard, click the Clone button in the top right.
A dialog appears that allow to choose the title of the new cloned
dashboard.

image:15d88cecd1633e.png[image]

Type a name and click the Confirm Clone button. This creates a new
Dashboard with all the same configurations.

image:15d88cecd1edb3.png[image]

The same happens if you click the Edit button (top right) and then save
the dashboard as new. It is possible to change the new dashboard
configurations and save it; the original Graph Browser configurations
will not change.


== Shortest Path limitations

You can run a script within Graph Browser to determine the shortest path
between selected nodes in a dataset.

The time to calculate the shortest path is dependent on the size and
schema of the dataset. With this script, the ability to calculate the
shortest path is limited by the graph expansion limit. You can modify
this setting (`+siren:graphExpansionLimit+`), which is documented in
xref:module-siren-investigate:management.adoc#_setting_advanced_options[Setting advanced
options].

CAUTION: Increasing the `+siren:graphExpansionLimit+` value will negatively
affect the Graph Browser performance.


If you are working with Neo4j data, you can use a Neo4j Shortest Path
script instead, which should provide better performance. See
xref:module-siren-investigate:data-reflection.adoc#_adding_a_shortest_path_script_for_neo4j[Adding a Shortest Path
script for Neo4j] for details.


== Jexl operators

There are a number of operators which can be applied to the `+payload+`
data for transformation, comparison, and so on.

Here are a selection, there are further details at the
https://github.com/TomFrost/Jexl[Jexl] GitHub page.

*Operators.*

Use these operators to perform mathematical operations on values

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Operation |Symbol |Example
|Negate |`+!+` |`+!true+` ⇒ `+false+`
|Add/Concat |`+++` |`+3 + 4+` ⇒ `+7+`
|Subtract |`+-+` |`+4 - 3+` ⇒ `+1+`
|Multiply |`+*+` |`+3 * 8+` ⇒ `+24+`
|Divide |`+/+` |`+15 / 4+` ⇒ `+3.75+`
|Divide and Floor |`+//+` |`+15 // 4+` ⇒ `+3+`
|Modulus |`+%+` |`+23 % 2+` ⇒ `+1+`
|Power of |`+^+` |`+2^3+` ⇒ `+8+`
|Logical AND |`+&&+` |`+true && true+` ⇒ `+true+`
|Logical OR |`+||+` |`true
|===

*Comparisons.*

Use these expressions to compare two values, the Boolean results can be
used for, for example filtering.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Operation |Symbol |Example
|Equal |`+==+` |`+1 == 2+` ⇒ `+false+`

|Not Equal |`+!=+` |`+1 != 2+` ⇒ `+true+`

|Greater Than |`+>+` |`+2 > 3+` ⇒ `+false+`

|Greater Than or Equal |`+>=+` |`+3 >= 3+` ⇒ `+true+`

|Less Than |`+<+` |`+2 < 3+` ⇒ `+true+`

|Less Than or Equal |`+<=+` |`+2 ⇐ 4+` ⇒ `+true+`

|Element in array or string |`+in+`
|`+"cat" in ["cat", "dog", "mouse"]+` ⇒ `+true+`
|===

*Conditional Operators.*

Conditional operators return the second or third expression based on the
result of the first expression. If the first expression
(`+"Bob" in ["Bob", "Mary"]+` below) return `+true+`, "Yes" is returned.
If it returns false, "No" is returned.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Example |Result
|"Bob" `+in+` ["Bob", "Mary"] ? "Yes" : "No" |"Yes"
|===

*Identifiers.*

Access variables in the payload with dot notation or by using brackets,
for example:

....
{
  name: {
    first: 'John'
    last: 'Smith'
  },
  age: 55,
  colleagues: [
    'Mary',
    'Bob',
    'Ted'
  ],
  teammate: 2
}
....

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Example |Result
|name.first |"John"
|colleagues[teammate] |"Ted"
|name['la' + 'st'] |"Smith"
|===

*Collection filtering.*

Arrays of objects (Collections) can be filtered by including a filter
expression in brackets. Properties of each collection can be referenced
by prefixing them with a leading dot. The result is an array of objects
for which the filter returns a truthy value.

....
{
  users: [
    { first: 'John', last: 'Smith', age: 20},
    { first: 'Mary', last: 'Jones', age: 46},
    { first: 'Ted', last: 'Cotter', age: 16},
    { first: 'Bob', last: 'White', age: 66}
  ],
  adult: 21
}
....

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Example |Result
|users[.last == 'Jones'] |[\{ first: 'Mary', last: 'Jones', age: 46}]

|users[.age < adult] |[\{ first: 'John', last: 'Smith', age: 20}, first:
'Ted', last: 'Cotter', age: 16}]

|users[first == 'John'].last |"Smith"
|===

*Lens Expression Functions*

In addition to the general Jexl parsing functionality, Siren Investigate
also exposes a number of JavaScript-like functions for use in Lens
Expressions. Payload values (or the results from earlier parsing) are
piped into the function using the `+|+` character. These values become
the `+val+` parameter for the functions below - meaning the `+val+` does
not need to be added in the `+()+` after the function name. In some
cases, this value is all that is needed by the function and some
functions require extra parameters.

Some functions require string inputs and some require integer or
floating-point inputs

== Link analysis

Siren enables you to group nodes manually or automatically based on
shared properties, for example:

* All records located in France or Germany.
* All IPs in server room A.
* All patients from the placebo clinical trial arm.

This can reduce graph clutter and make it easier to discover patterns
and drill down into clusters during analysis.

For example, the following image shows companies clustered by US state
in which their headquarters are located.

image:15d88cecd26f31.png[Grouping on nodes]
