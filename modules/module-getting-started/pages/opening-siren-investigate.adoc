After starting Elasticsearch and Siren Investigate as described in
link:/document/preview/60105#UUID-ad5acfa5-c766-aa9f-8905-ce328430518d[Setting

== Navigation sidebar

The left sidebar is used to navigate between apps in Siren Investigate.

It can be expanded or contracted using the
expand/contract (image:expand-contract-icon.png[]) button at the
bottom of the sidebar.

By default, Siren Investigate displays the *Articles* dashboard.
link:/document/preview/60374#UUID-5afa51ba-58f9-7db3-2d76-e57e93492ecc[Dashboards]
can be configured to display multiple
link:/document/preview/60229#UUID-c031aad7-904c-e18b-ac34-c5e8afe57dbd[visualizations]
on the documents stored in a specific index or returned by a
link:/document/preview/60188#UUID-68ef86a4-bb7a-1344-eac2-bf7d24b03a48[saved
search] on an index pattern.

Each dashboard is represented by a tab containing the dashboard title
and the number of documents available for visualizations.

You can quickly search specific articles through the search input in the
navigation bar. For example, let’s find all the articles written about
_wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_:

We can immediately see that there are 11595 articles about those topics
and all the visualizations are refreshed to aggregate data for this
subset of articles.

NOTE: In addition to simple text, queries in the search bar can be written
using the Lucene
https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html[query
syntax], or
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch
