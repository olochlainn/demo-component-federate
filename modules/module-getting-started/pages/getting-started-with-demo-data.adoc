= Getting started with demo data
:output-html:

Download the Siren Platform preloaded demo from
https://siren.io/downloads/?product=siren-platform-demo-data[www.siren.io/downloads].

The demonstration includes a ready-to-use Elasticsearch cluster in the
`+elasticsearch+` folder. The cluster contains the following indices:

[cols=",",]
|===
|`+company+` |A collection of companies
|`+article+` |A collection of articles about companies
|`+investment+` |A collection of investments in companies
|`+investor+` |A collection of investors
|`+.siren+` |Siren Investigate configuration
|===

The indices were populated with
https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] from the SQLite
database in `+siren-investigate/crunchbase.db+`, as described in
xref:module-siren-investigate:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[Legacy REST datasources].



NOTE: The demonstration data set was built from a sample of articles, which
were gathered from tech blogs and from data about companies, investments
and investors in the CrunchBase 2013 Snapshot, which is copyright © 2013
CrunchBase Inc.

== User access

You can access the demonstration as three different users:

* `+sirenadmin+` has read access to all data indices and can modify the
Siren Investigate configuration.
* `+sirenuser+` has read access to all data indices but cannot modify
the Siren Investigate configuration.
* `+sirennoinvestor+` has read access to all data indices except
`+investor+`. The user has no access to the `+Investors+` dashboard.

The password for all users is `+password+`.


== Opening Siren Investigate

After starting Elasticsearch and Siren Investigate as described in
ifdef::output-pdf[<<module-siren-investigate/pages/setting-up-siren-investigate.adoc#,Setting up Siren Investigate,>>]
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:setting-up-siren-investigate.adoc[Setting up Siren Investigate,]]
from your web browser navigate to
\http://localhost:5606.

=== Navigation sidebar

The left sidebar is used to navigate between apps in Siren Investigate.

It can be expanded or contracted using the
expand/contract (image:expand-contract-icon.png[]) button at the
bottom of the sidebar.

By default, Siren Investigate displays the *Articles* dashboard.
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:dashboard.adoc[Dashboards]]
can be configured to display multiple
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc[visualizations]]
on the documents stored in a specific index or returned by a
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:discover.adoc#_searching_your_data[saved search]]
on an index pattern.

Each dashboard is represented by a tab containing the dashboard title
and the number of documents available for visualizations.

image:articles-dashboard.png[]

You can quickly search specific articles through the search input in the
navigation bar. For example, let’s find all the articles written about
_wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_:

image:dashboard-search-bar.png[]

We can immediately see that there are 11595 articles about those topics
and all the visualizations are refreshed to aggregate data for this
subset of articles.

NOTE: In addition to simple text, queries in the search bar can be written
using the Lucene
https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html[query
syntax], or
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch
Query DSL].


== Filtering results

Visualizations can be used to create filters. For example, you can see
all the articles about _wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_ published by TechCrunch by
clicking the TechCrunch slice inside the Articles by Source 
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc#_pie_chart[pie chart]]
visualization.

image:pie-slice.png[Pie slice]

image:filter-on-slice-applied.png[Dashboard with filter on the slice
applied]

NOTE: To switch off a filter, move the mouse pointer over it and click the
check box icon. To switch off all the filters applied to the dashboard,
click *Actions* then *Disable*.


== Creating filters with the Relational Navigator

// Needs link to Relational Navigator

The
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:relational-browsing.adoc#_relational_navigator[Relational Navigator]] 
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:relational-browsing.adoc#_relational_navigator[Relational Navigator]]
visualization enables you to create cross-dashboard filters.
For example, from *Companies* in the dashboard, you can see that there
are 470 companies mentioned in TechCrunch articles about _wireless_ or
_Wi-Fi_.

image:relational-filter-articles-to-companies.png[Relational filter from articles to
companies]

The relational filter created by clicking the button is displayed in the
filter bar, and can be switched off or removed, just like any other
filter. Moving the mouse pointer over the filter will display the list
of joined indices and their filters:

image:relational-filter-in-filter-bar.png[Relational filter in the filter bar]

Relational filters can be accumulated. For example, if you click
Investment rounds →, you will see data about the 351 investment rounds
related to a subset of 470 companies mentioned in the TechCrunch
articles about _wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_. For more information, see
ifdef::output-html[xref:module-siren-investigate:relational-browsing.adoc#_relational_navigator[Relational Navigator.]]


== Query based aggregations

It is possible to get additional information about companies by using
the results of queries on SQL databases (or any of the datasources
supported by Siren Investigate) as aggregations on Elasticsearch
documents.

For example, in the *Query on Companies* visualization you can see that
41 of the 96 companies have competitors, and eight of them are in the
top 500 companies by number of employees:

image:query-on-companies-dashboard.png[SQL based aggregations]

*Companies "With competitors"* and *Top 500 companies (HR count)* are
queries on the SQLite database. The records returned by the queries are used to
filter Elasticsearch documents, which can be then aggregated in a
metric.

To better understand this feature, let’s examine the *Top 500 companies
(HR count)* query. To see the query, click *Saved Objects* in the
*Management* menu.

image:saved-objects-in-management-menu.png[image]

The query returns
the `+id+`, `+label+` and `+number_of_employees+` columns from
the company table for the top 500 companies by number of employees:

[source,sql]
----
select id, label, number_of_employees
from company
where number_of_employees>0
order by number_of_employees desc
limit 500
----

Click *Dashboard*, then *Edit*, and then *Edit*
(image:15dad79288e41a.png[image]) in the heading of the *Query on
Companies* visualization to customize its configuration. The *metrics*
section defines the aggregations on Elasticsearch documents, displayed
as columns in the table. The *buckets* section defines the groups of
Elasticsearch documents aggregated by metrics, displayed as row headers
in the table.

image:edit-query-on-companies-visualization.png[image]

By expanding the *Split Rows* section inside buckets you can see how the
queries are used to define groups of Elasticsearch documents. Scroll
down to see the configuration of the fourth filter:

image:filter-configuration.png[image]

The filter is configured to execute the query *Top 500 companies (HR
count)* on the SQLite database and return the group of Elasticsearch
documents from the current search whose *ID* is equal to one of the IDs
in the query results. The documents are then processed by
the _Count_ metric.

Let’s add a new aggregation to show the average number of employees.
Click *Add metrics* inside the *metrics* section, then
select *Metric* as the metric type; select *Average* as the aggregation
and `+number_of_employees+` as the field, then click *Apply
Changes* (image:15dad7928ab3a2.png[image]).

Save the visualization by clicking *Save*, then click
the *Dashboard* tab to see the updated visualization in
the *Companies* dashboard:

image:save-query-on-companies-visualization.png[image]

Click *Add sub-buckets* at the bottom, then select *Split Rows* as the
bucket type. Choose the *Terms* aggregation and the *countrycode* field
from the boxes. Click *Apply
Changes* (image:15dad7928ab3a2.png[image]) to add an external ring
with the new results.

image:add-subbuckets.png[image]

For an in-depth explanation of aggregations, see xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc#_creating_a_
visualization[Creating a visualization].

In addition to defining groups to aggregate, queries can be used as
filters. To see this click *Dashboard*, then in the *Query on
Companies* dashboard, move the mouse pointer over the row
for *Top-500-companies-(HR-count)* and click the plus (*+*) icon that
appears.

image:query-on-companies-dashboard.png[image]

Then you will see only the companies mentioned in the articles which are
also in the top 500 by number of employees:

image:dashboard-companies.png[image]


== Datasource entity selection

It is possible to select a company entity (record) in the SQLite
database (and entities in
xref:module-siren-investigate:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[external
datasources] in general) by clicking its label in the Companies
Table.

The selected entity can be used as a parameter in queries;
for example, click *Browshot* in Companies Table:

image:15dad7928e721a.png[Entity selection]

Selecting an entity enables additional queries on external datasources.
For example, in the _Query on Companies_ visualization you can see that,
amongst the top 500 companies by number of employees mentioned in
articles about _wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_, _Browshot_ has 487 competitors and
there are nineteen companies in the same domain. All widgets affected by
the selected entity are marked by a purple header.

For the Y-axis metrics aggregation, select *Unique Count*, with
*speaker* as the field. For Shakespeare plays, it may be useful to know
which plays have the lowest number of distinct speaking parts, if your
theater company is short on actors. For the X-Axis buckets, select the
*Terms* aggregation with the `+play_name+` field. For the *Order*,
select *Ascending*, leaving the *Size* at `+5+`.

Leave the other elements at their default values and click *Apply
Changes* (image:15dad7928ab3a2.png[image]).

Selecting an entity also enables the display of additional data in the
Company Info visualization; by clicking the _(show)_ links you can
toggle the list of companies in the same domain and competitors. The
data in the tables is fetched from queries on the SQLite database, using
the selected company ID as a parameter. The queries are rendered using
xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc#_query-viewer[customizable
templates], which will be introduced later.

The selected entity appears as a light blue box on the right of the
filter bar; to deselect an entity, click the bin icon displayed when
moving the mouse pointer over the purple box.

For more information about entity selection, see xref:module-siren-investigate:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[Legacy
REST datasources].


== Enhanced search results

The xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc#_record_table_visualization[Record Table visualization] displays the
current set of Elasticsearch documents as a table. For example,
Companies Table is configured to display the following fields:

* Time (foundation date)
* label (the company name)
* description
* category_code
* founded_year
* countrycode
* Why Relevant? (a relational column])

image:15dad792900450.png[Companies Table]

Select *Edit*, then click Edit (image:15dad79288e41a.png[image])
to choose which fields to display and customize the order of the
columns. If the index is time based, the Time column will always be
displayed.

Click the right arrow to expand the first row, then scroll down to the
homepage_url field and click the *Toggle column* icon:

image:15dad79290bfb7.png[Column positioning.]

You can click the arrows to move the column to the desired position:

image:15dad79291837a.png[Column positioning.]

[[UUID-a2889ce5-7702-f194-c7e2-b3a908012bed]]
=== Click handlers

You can define click handlers on cells to perform several actions. Let’s
add a click handler to open the company homepage when clicking the cell
displaying the URL.

The table is preconfigured with a click handler on `+label+` that is
used to select an entity in the SQLite database.

. Go into edit mode.

. Scroll through the view options and click Add click handler.

. From the Column box, select homepage_url.

. From the On click I want to box, select Follow the URL.

. Select homepage_url as the URL field,  then click *Apply
Changes* (image:15dad7928ab3a2.png[image]).

You can test the click handler immediately by clicking a cell displaying
a homepage URL in the preview displayed on the right:

image:15dad792921e78.png[URL click handler.]


=== Relational columns

You can enable the relational column to be displayed when an
Elasticsearch document is matched by a query on the SQLite database. The
relational column reports on the relationship, based on the queries
configured.

In the following example, in the _Companies Table_, you can see that
`+Big Fish+` is listed here because it has competitors.

image:15dad79292ce1f.png[Relational column example.]

image:15dad792936ef7.png[Relational column configuration]


=== Saving the visualization

Click *Save* in the top right to save the visualization, then click
Dashboard to go back to the Companies dashboard. For additional
documentation about this visualization, see xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc#_record_table_visualization[Record Table visualization].


== Query templates

*Company Info*, which is an instance of a Siren Investigate query viewer
visualization, displays the results of three SQL queries by rendering
their results through templates. The queries take the selected entity ID
as an input and the associated templates are displayed only when an
entity is selected.

image:15dad792940b75.png[Siren Investigate query viewer example]

The association between the query and templates can be set in the
visualization configuration:

image:15dad79294b165.png[Siren Investigate query viewer
configuration.]

Query templates can be managed by clicking the Management icon, then
select Advanced Settings followed by Templates.

For more information about templates, see xref:module-siren-investigate:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[Legacy REST
datasources]. For more information about visualization, see xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc#_record_table_visualization[Record Table visualization].
