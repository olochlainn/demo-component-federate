= Getting started with demo data

Download the Siren Platform preloaded demo from
https://siren.io/downloads/?product=siren-platform-demo-data[www.siren.io/downloads].

The demonstration includes a ready-to-use Elasticsearch cluster in the
`+elasticsearch+` folder. The cluster contains the following indices:

[cols=",",]
|===
|`+company+` |A collection of companies
|`+article+` |A collection of articles about companies
|`+investment+` |A collection of investments in companies
|`+investor+` |A collection of investors
|`+.siren+` |Siren Investigate configuration
|===

The indices were populated with
https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] from the SQLite
database in `+siren-investigate/crunchbase.db+`, as described in
xref:module-siren-investigate:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[Legacy REST datasources].



NOTE: The demonstration data set was built from a sample of articles, which
were gathered from tech blogs and from data about companies, investments
and investors in the CrunchBase 2013 Snapshot, which is copyright Â© 2013
