= Getting started with demo data

Download the Siren Platform preloaded demo from
https://siren.io/downloads/?product=siren-platform-demo-data[www.siren.io/downloads].

The demonstration includes a ready-to-use Elasticsearch cluster in the
`+elasticsearch+` folder. The cluster contains the following indices:

[cols=",",]
|===
|`+company+` |A collection of companies
|`+article+` |A collection of articles about companies
|`+investment+` |A collection of investments in companies
|`+investor+` |A collection of investors
|`+.siren+` |Siren Investigate configuration
|===

The indices were populated with
https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] from the SQLite
database in `+siren-investigate/crunchbase.db+`, as described in
xref:module-siren-investigate:legacy-rest-datasources.adoc[Legacy REST datasources].



NOTE: The demonstration data set was built from a sample of articles, which
were gathered from tech blogs and from data about companies, investments
and investors in the CrunchBase 2013 Snapshot, which is copyright © 2013
CrunchBase Inc.

== User access

You can access the demonstration as three different users:

* `+sirenadmin+` has read access to all data indices and can modify the
Siren Investigate configuration.
* `+sirenuser+` has read access to all data indices but cannot modify
the Siren Investigate configuration.
* `+sirennoinvestor+` has read access to all data indices except
`+investor+`. The user has no access to the `+Investors+` dashboard.

The password for all users is `+password+`.


== Opening Siren Investigate

After starting Elasticsearch and Siren Investigate as described in
xref:module-siren-investigate:setting-up-siren-investigate.adoc[Setting
up Siren Investigate], from your web browser navigate to
http://localhost:5606.

== Navigation sidebar

The left sidebar is used to navigate between apps in Siren Investigate.

It can be expanded or contracted using the
expand/contract (image:expand-contract-icon.png[]) button at the
bottom of the sidebar.

By default, Siren Investigate displays the *Articles* dashboard.
xref:module-siren-investigate:dashboards.adoc[Dashboards]
can be configured to display multiple
xref:module-siren-investigate:visualizations.adoc[visualizations]
on the documents stored in a specific index or returned by a
xref:module-siren-investigate:searching-your-data.adoc[saved
search] on an index pattern.

Each dashboard is represented by a tab containing the dashboard title
and the number of documents available for visualizations.

You can quickly search specific articles through the search input in the
navigation bar. For example, let’s find all the articles written about
_wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_:

image:dashboard-search-bar.png[]

We can immediately see that there are 11595 articles about those topics
and all the visualizations are refreshed to aggregate data for this
subset of articles.

NOTE: In addition to simple text, queries in the search bar can be written
using the Lucene
https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html[query
syntax], or
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch
Query DSL].


=- Filtering results

Visualizations can be used to create filters. For example, you can see
all the articles about _wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_ published by TechCrunch by
clicking the TechCrunch slice inside the Articles by
Source xref:module-siren-investigate:pie-chart.adoc[pie
chart] visualization.

image:filter-on-slice-applied.png[Dashboard with filter on the slice
applied]

NOTE: To switch off a filter, move the mouse pointer over it and click the
check box icon. To switch off all the filters applied to the dashboard,
click *Actions* then *Disable*.


= Creating filters with the Relational Navigator

// Needs link to Relational Navigator

The
xref:module-siren-investigate:relational-navigator.adoc[Relational
Navigator] visualization enables you to create cross-dashboard filters.
For example, from *Companies* in the dashboard, you can see that there
are 470 companies mentioned in TechCrunch articles about _wireless_ or
_Wi-Fi_.

image:relational-filter-articles-to-companies.png[Relational filter from articles to
companies]

The relational filter created by clicking the button is displayed in the
filter bar, and can be switched off or removed, just like any other
filter. Moving the mouse pointer over the filter will display the list
of joined indices and their filters:

image:relational-filter-in-filter-bar.png[Relational filter in the filter bar]

Relational filters can be accumulated. For example, if you click
Investment rounds →, you will see data about the 351 investment rounds
related to a subset of 470 companies mentioned in the TechCrunch
articles about _wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_. For more information,
see xref:module-siren-investigate:relational-navigator.adoc[Relational
Navigator].
