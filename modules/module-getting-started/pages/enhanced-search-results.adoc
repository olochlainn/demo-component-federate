The link:#[Record Table visualization] displays the
current set of Elasticsearch documents as a table. For example,
Companies Table is configured to display the following fields:

* Time (foundation date)
* label (the company name)
* description
* category_code
* founded_year
* countrycode
* Why Relevant? (a
link:[relational
column])

Select *Edit*, then click Edit (image:image/15d764ed143f43.png[image])
to choose which fields to display and customize the order of the
columns. If the index is time based, the Time column will always be
displayed.

Click the right arrow to expand the first row, then scroll down to the
homepage_url field and click the Toggle column icon:

== Click handlers

You can define click handlers on cells to perform several actions. Let’s
add a click handler to open the company homepage when clicking the cell
displaying the URL.

The table is preconfigured with a click handler on `+label+` that is
used to select an entity in the SQLite database.

. Go into edit mode.

. Scroll through the view options and click *Add click handler*.

. From the Column box, select homepage_url.

. From the On click I want to box, select *Follow the URL*.

. Select homepage_url as the URL field,  then click *Apply
Changes* (image:image/15d764ed153f9c.png[image]).

You can test the click handler immediately by clicking a cell displaying
a homepage URL in the preview displayed on the right:

== Relational columns

You can enable the relational column to be displayed when an
Elasticsearch document is matched by a query on the SQLite database. The
relational column reports on the relationship, based on the queries
configured.

In the following example, in the _Companies Table_, you can see that
`+Big Fish+` is listed here because it has competitors.
