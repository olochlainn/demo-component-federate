= Creating filters with the Relational Navigator

// Needs link to Relational Navigator

The
xref:module-siren-investigate:relational-navigator.adoc[Relational
Navigator] visualization enables you to create cross-dashboard filters.
For example, from *Companies* in the dashboard, you can see that there
are 470 companies mentioned in TechCrunch articles about _wireless_ or
_Wi-Fi_.

The relational filter created by clicking the button is displayed in the
filter bar, and can be switched off or removed, just like any other
filter. Moving the mouse pointer over the filter will display the list
of joined indices and their filters:

Relational filters can be accumulated. For example, if you click
Investment rounds →, you will see data about the 351 investment rounds
related to a subset of 470 companies mentioned in the TechCrunch
articles about _wireless_ or _Wi-Fi_. For more information,
