= Query templates

*Company Info*, which is an instance of a Siren Investigate query viewer
visualization, displays the results of three SQL queries by rendering
their results through templates. The queries take the selected entity ID
as an input and the associated templates are displayed only when an
entity is selected.

The association between the query and templates can be set in the
visualization configuration:

Query templates can be managed by clicking the Management icon, then
select Advanced Settings followed by Templates.
