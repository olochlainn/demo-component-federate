= Authentication

Siren Alert supports authentication using
https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard[Search Guard]. There are
several options available.


== Authenticate search request

Kibana https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/auth-reference.html[Elasticsearch
basic authentication] is used for authentication.

*Valid certificate*

....
sentinl:
  settings:
    authentication:
      enabled: true
      username: 'elastic'
      password: 'password'
      cert:
        selfsigned: false
        pem: '/path/to/pem/key'
....

*Self-signed certificate*

....
sentinl:
  settings:
    authentication:
      enabled: true
      username: 'elastic'
      password: 'password'
      cert:
        selfsigned: true
....

*Siren Platform*

Authenticate Siren Alert using single user - default `+sentinl+` from
Access Control app. For example, default `+investigate.yml+`.

+

....
# Access Control configuration
investigate_access_control:
  enabled: true
  cookie:
password: "12345678123456781234567812345678"
  admin_role: kibiadmin
  sentinl:
elasticsearch:
  username: sentinl
  password: password
...
....

*Siren Platform or Kibana*

It is possible to create multiple user credentials and assign these
credentials to watchers, one credential per watcher, thereby
authenticating each watcher separately. It is called impersonation.

[arabic]
. Create credentials in Search Guard or X-Pack and assign the
permissions you need. You need one user for Sentinl and one user per
watcher.
. Set Siren Alert authentication.
+
....
sentinl:
  settings:
    authentication:
      enabled: true
      impersonate: true
      username: 'elastic'
      password: 'password'
      sha: '6859a748bc07b49ae761f5734db66848'
      cert:
        selfsigned: true
....
* Set password as clear text in `+password+` property. The password can
be put in encrypted form instead. Set password hash in `+sha+` property,
now you can remove `+password+` option.
* Use `+sentinl/scripts/encryptPassword.js+` script to obtain the hash.
Edit the value of the `+plainTextPassword+` variable, replacing
`+admin+` with your password. Copy the generated hash and paste as the
`+sha+` value. Also, you can change password hashing complexity by
setting options inside `+encryption+`.
https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html[Node.js crypto library] is used to
hash and unhash user password.
. Set watcher
authentication. `+encryptPassword.js+``+password+``+username+``+impersonate: true+`.
