= Siren Alert FAQ

*Why are emails are not being sent?*

Siren Alert uses `+emailjs+` to send emails. This NPM module requires a
correct message to be formed, so make sure your configuration includes
valid `+from+` and `+to+` values, as well as the proper authentication
method for your email relay. For more information, refer to the
`+emailjs+` https://github.com/eleith/emailjs[documentation].

*Why are reports not being generated?*

Siren Alert uses either `+node-horseman+` or `+puppeteer+` to generate
reports. The `+node-horseman+` NPM module requires PhantomJS to be
installed on the computer running KaaE and Reports, and `+puppeteer+`
requires Chrome. The default engine used is `+puppeteer+`, but this can
be changed to `+horseman+` with the `+sentinl.settings.report.engine+`
configuration property.

*Why are watchers not running in my timezone?*

Siren Alert uses the UTC timezone internally to execute schedule. While
rolling watchers are not affected (that is _every x minutes_), the UTC
timezone is used for absolute timed executions.

*How can I avoid string encoding in mustache templates output?*

Siren Alert uses Mustache to enrich the messages of actions with data
from its execution. If you want to use double braces without them being
replaced, use triple braces (`+{{{hello}}}+`). For more information,
refer to the Mustache
https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html[documentation].

*How can I use Siren Alert with ReadonlyREST authentication?*

When using ReadonlyREST, the following exceptions should be added to
theÂ Siren Alert configuration:

....
- name: ALLOWPOST
  type: allow
  methods: [POST,HEAD,GET,DELETE,OPTIONS]
  uri_re:  ^/watcher_alarms-.*/
  hosts: [localhost]
  verbosity: info

- name: ALLOWHEAD
  type: allow
  methods: [POST,HEAD,GET,DELETE]
  uri_re:  ^/watcher.*/
  hosts: [localhost]
  verbosity: info
....

*How can I use Siren Alert with Search Guard authentication?*

Here is an example to use Siren Alert with Search Guard. For more
information, see link:#[?xml_title].

[arabic]
. Edit the `+sg_kibana_server+` role in `+sg_roles.yml+`:
+
....
sg_kibana_server:
  cluster:
    - CLUSTER_MONITOR
    - CLUSTER_COMPOSITE_OPS
indices:
  '?kibana':
    '*':
      - INDICES_ALL
  'watcher':
    '*':
      :
        - MANAGE
        - CREATE_INDEX
        - INDEX
        - READ
        - WRITE
        - DELETE
....
. Reinitialize Search Guard afterwards. For example:
+
....
elasticsearch-6.3.2$ ./plugins/search-guard-6/tools/sgadmin.sh -cd plugins/search-guard-6/sgconfig/ -icl -ts config/truststore.jks -ks config/keystore.jks -h localhost -p 9300 -nhnv
....
