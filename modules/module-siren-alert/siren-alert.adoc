= Siren Alert

Siren Alert provides alerting and reporting functionality to monitor,
notify and report on data series changes using standard queries,
programmable validators, and a variety of configurable actions.

It integrates the standalone
https://sentinl.readthedocs.io/en/docs/[Sentinl] application into the
Siren platform. In this section, Sentinl is used as a synonym of Siren
Alert. 

Siren Alert provides equivalent functionality to 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/watcher/current/introduction.html["Watcher"]
and https://www.elastic.co/products/reporting["Reporting"], expanded by
unique Siren Investigate features.

It is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing alerts
and reports in Siren Investigate using its integrated App and Spy
integration.
