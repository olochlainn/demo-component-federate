= Distributed Join Workflow

When sending a (multi) search request with one or more nested joins, the node receiving the request
will become the "`Coordinator`". The coordinator node is in charge of controlling and executing a "`Job`" across the
available nodes in the cluster. A job represents the full workflow of the execution of a (multi) search request.
A job is composed of one or more "`Tasks`". A task represent a single type of operations, such as a `Search/Project`
or `Join`, that is executed by a "`Worker`" on a node. A worker is a thread that will perform a task and report the
outcome of the task to the coordinator.

For example, the following search request joining the index `companies` with `articles`:

[source,js]
-----------------------------------------------------------
GET /_siren/companies/search
{
   "query" : {
      "join" : {
        "type": "HASH_JOIN",
        "indices" : ["articles"],
        "on": ["id", "mentions"],
        "request" : {
          "query" : {
            "match_all": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

will produce the following workflow:

The coordinator will execute a `Search/Project` task on every shard of the `companies` and `articles` indices.
These tasks will first execute a search query to compute the matching documents, then scan the `id` and `mentions`
fields of the matching documents and shuffle them to all the nodes of the cluster. Once these tasks are completed,
the coordinator will execute a `Hash Join` task on every node of the cluster. The `Hash Join` task will join the
two streams of data that were sent by the two previous `Search/Project` tasks to compute a set of document ids
for the `companies` index. These documents ids will be transferred back to their respective shards and used to
filter the `companies` index.

This particular workflow enables Federate to push all the filtering predicates (e.g., terms, range, boolean
queries) down to Elasticsearch, leveraging the indices for fast computation. The `Join` task is currently limited
to compute the intersection of two different set of documents based on a join condition. This reduces the amount of
data allocated in memory, the amount of data transferred across the network, and the workload performed by a task.
